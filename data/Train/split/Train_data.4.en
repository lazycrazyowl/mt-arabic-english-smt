Copts in Egypt are part of the nation's fabric, the deputies pointed out.
The members added that in earlier sittings, they voiced their opposition to any foreign interference in Egypt's internal affairs, including bonds between the two elements of the nation, rejecting any attempt to use the crisis, which cropped up due to reports by Al-Nabaa, as a pretext for a US and European interference in Egypt's internal affairs on the grounds of protecting Copts and defending their rights.
The United States of America started to pressurize the government, urging it to revise the projects, financed by Washington via the Social Fund for Development (SFD).
It is to be mentioned that the USA discovered that Hussein Al-Gammal, SFD Secretary General, appointed Congressmen and Egyptian expatriates in the US in projects financed by Washington and for which it earmarks tremendous money without the approval of the donor bodies. Moreover, the targets of these projects are distant from those of the SFD.
The Egyptian-European Union (EU) states trade balance deficit went down by $1.5 billion last year, as it reached $2.903 billion compared with about $4.432 billion in 1999, which positively impacted on the rise of exports' coverage of imports to 39.5% in 2000 against 21% in 1999.

The Egyptian-EU trade volume amounted to about $6.328 billion in 1996. Then, the volume rose as it reached $6.604 and $7.151 billion, a growth rate of 4.43% and 8.3% in 1997 and 1998 respectively. The volume then declined to $6.904 billion in 1999 and $6.703 billion in 2000.

He also stressed the importance and the depth of economic relations between Egypt and Germany. The chamber will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the start of its operation in Egypt this year.
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES RESEARCH CENTRE REPORT: COMMODITY STOCK VALUE ROSE TO LE8.5 BILLION LAST YEAR
On the other hand, the report unfolded that the rate of work production remained stationary in the last decade of 20th century, at an average of no more than 1.7% and in the range of 1.15% and 2.1%.
It pointed out that the domestic contribution to generating such a growth is so low that no saving rates exceeded 17.1% in 1998/1999 compared with a rate of 30%- 35% in East and South Asian countries, which makes a doubling of the current saving rates really a must.
It went on to say that a continuation of commodity trade balance deficit and uncertainty about other foreign exchange sources would generate pressure on the reserve balance of foreign exchange with the CBE, which declined, a few years ago, from $21 billion in 1997 to $14 billion in August 2000 which can hardly cover 82% of imports according to their volume in the last year. The gravity of such a deficit not only lies in the fact that it would make it difficult for the CBE to maintain the Egyptian pound rates or exchange against declined by 2% against the dollar in the last 5 years but also lies in the graver fact that Egypt would go back to its previous reliance for financing imports on foreign loans, which would consequently rise back to even higher levels than those ever known in the late 1980's when the volume of the total debt went very close to about $52 billion.

Dr. Nassar stressed that Egypt had achieved enormous gains under the new partnership agreement with Europe, especially the rise in the quota of potato exports to Europe without customs tariffs from 110 thousand tons annually in the 1977-1997 agreement to 130 thousand tons in the first year and 190,000 tons in the second year, then to 250,000 tons in the third year.

The report valued the total interest expenditure at about LE204 million in 2000 against LE126 million in 1999, an increase of 62%. This was the result of having dollar bonds issued by the company in December 1999 at a value of $86 million, whose maturity date fall due in 2003.
Consequently, Ahmed Ezz would have nothing to do except getting rid of the rival factories to increase the prices of reinforcing iron on the local market to find a way out of his financial crisis. Initially, he managed to get rid of the foreign competitors through lodging dumping suits under which dumping charges were imposed on iron. Thus, the market quota of Al-Ezz and Al-Dekheila Companies increased from 60% in 1999 to 69% in 2000.

Shukry said neither he nor the Labor Party nominated a Party member for the post of Press Syndicate chairman. Magdy Ahmed Hussein's candidature is an individual, not partisan, act, he added.
Saudi exports to Iraq have totalled 2.57 billion riyals ($686.3 million) since the beginning of 1999 till the previous couple of weeks. There has been an increase in the number of Saudi companies willing to deal with Iraq now hitting some 30 companies, one of them an affiliate of the Saudi Arabian Basic Industries Company (SABIC), which the government owns 70% of its capital, and the Saudi Company for Iron and Steel (Hadid), the biggest producer of reinforcing iron bars and steel sheets in the Gulf area.

MR/ Al-Akhbar, 1/7/2001
This step comes within the framework of the efforts exerted by the CBE to abort any attempt made by some international gangs to dump Egypt with dirty funds.
In its new controls, the CBE stressed the necessity of giving special attention to banking operations, especially the opening of documentary credits in huge amounts that outstrip the volume and nature of the clients' activities or where the beneficiary is not closely related to the client abroad. It also stressed the necessity of discounting mercantile papers from which a foreign party unknown to the bank benefits without any justifications for such a procedure. The new controls, furthermore, requested probing the cases where too large remittances are made for the relevant activities.

The strategic stock of fertilizers has recently plummeted to 500,000 tons, at a time when the price of a fertilizer bag rose from LE30 to LE40. This situation may lead to a return of fertilizer crisis and a soaring of its prices during the summer season, a matter which increases the costs of agricultural production.
PALESTINIAN ISLAMISTS: ATTITUDE TOWARDS RESISTANCE & SETTLEMENT
It set a good example of the believers' ability and will to rebel against the balance of powers, and won a victory under very complicated circumstances.
The Islamists have been ready for maintaining resistance without having any problem if it is invested reasonably by the PNA. In the meantime, they used to assert that occupation would only succumb to the language of force and it could be defeated, as was the case in Lebanon. They asked their brothers to put hand in hand to continue depleting the forces of the enemy till they could expel it from the territories it occupied in 1967 in preparation for uprooting its plans from the whole region to defend the nation's dignity.
As long as occupation exists, the resistance forces will continue their activities as much as they could. These forces are ready to pay the price whatever it may be.
Sure enough, the Islamic forces took a deep breath when the PNA rebelled against the core of the Oslo agreement, stood behind the uprising and kept silent about the resistance operation. Responding to this, the Islamic forces escalated the military action, something that was aspired after by the PNA and something that should have been maintained to subject Sharon (to the Palestinian requests) and achieve a true victory, as was the case in Lebanon.
AK/ Al-Hayat, 1/7/2001
Quoting the commander of the air forces in the Israeli army, the sources indicated that any activity launched against the Israeli army on the northern borders, would cause severe retaliation against those who have influence in Lebanon.

The number of financial and administrative corruption cases at the government bodies amounted to 63,269 last year.
Under the financial corruption cases, millions of public funds were wasted or seized, bids, tenders and purchases were tampered with, and stores were manipulated. Moreover, budgets were not controlled and the government bodies spent money lavishly, something that cost the State Treasury millions of pounds.
The Orthodox churches are located as follows: Al-Khatatba, Sadat city, Menoufeya; Tokh Tanabsha, Berkat Al-Sabe' city, Menoufeya; Al- Fashn city, Beni Suef; and Al-Mokatam, Cairo. The Evangelical ones will be sited in 15 May city, Helwan; Aboul-Matamir, Beheira; Al-Sawalih village, Tahtaha city; and Gerga city. The Catholic church will be built in Takseem Abu-Gabal, Dirout city.
This riotous demonstration form has never occurred even at the hardest of times like the deposing of Pope Shenouda III in the late President Sadat era in 1981 even though the matter was really weighty as the Pope was the symbol of the Church and the embodiment of Christ. But why did the demonstrations take such dimensions?
Remarkably too, the demonstrators generally belong to the middle class and lower middle class. Some were educated or university graduates. The reason for all that could have been the fact that a highly sensitive area in Coptic feelings had been encroached upon. Monasticism is holy to Christians and Al- Muharraq monastery had perhaps the same esteem in their hearts as Kabaa has in the hearts of Muslims.
Resorting to the Cathedral also reflects the failure of the political street to express the views of the ordinary citizen.
In his research entitled, "Probability of Christian Violence Groups Emergence", Coptic researcher, Soliman Shafik Says, "Christian violence starts when Church leaderships disappear as they now act as a safety valve. If the black turbaned Christian clergy lost all control over Christian grassroots including poor brackets of Christian society, then violence may pop out especially as both the poor and the middle classes have already lost confidence in the Coptic elite that seeking their own interests, publicly denied the existence of any Christian problems with the State or with the hard-line Islamists. This might consequently lead to some Copts running amok and developing any violent affiliations!
Last Wednesday, Israel made a successful test on a medium range ballistic missile Jericho 2B whose range stands at 1500 kilometers. The missile can reach most of the Arab capitals as well as southern parts of the former Soviet Union states, Al-Hayat learned from Western sources.
The Palestinians seek to purchase anti-aircraft missiles, he said adding that they opened fire more than once on the Israeli aircraft in the last few months.
According to available information, about three of the German companies that bought the Egyptian bonds are closely connected to the Jewish entity.

The report pointed out that Israel had succeeded in invading Arab countries with its pornographic films, which advocated homosexuality and permissiveness. Egypt came at the top of the list of consumers of Israeli porno movies. According to the report, Israel has also invaded some African and Asian countries with its pornography. The US Department of State noted that the sex industry had become a very profitable business in Israel and one of the main pillars of the Israeli economy and that the profits of that industry were among the revenues of the underground economy in Israel.
Political sources in Islamabad that were interviewed by Al Wasat believe that Southeast Asia is currently going through a remarkable strategic change, as evidenced by the feverish stockpiling of weapons by ambitious powers in that part of the world. It appears that there exists a worldwide agreement on supporting India's efforts for beefing up its military capabilities, as India is now able to import arms from the United States, Israel and Russia.
This boost of relations has resulted, as some reports have claimed, in New Delhi's acquisition of the technology for the Israeli Arrow missile, which is another milestone in relations that is similar to India's acquisition of nuclear technology in 1962.
Where the Arab-Israeli conflict is concerned, more than one Arab country have expressed fear of the Indian-Israeli alliance, particularly as this pact brings to mind the old Israeli policy of building a fence around outlying Arab countries.
Customs authorities in Sofia International Airport announced the discovery and frustration of an attempt to smuggle weapons to the Albans of Macedonia from an Arab country that they declined to specify.

INDIAN-ISRAELI-AMERICAN ALLIANCE CREATED AT EXPENSE OF PAKISTAN, AFGHANISTAN & ARABS
Meanwhile, India has forged ahead with its missile program. Last January, it was able to develop a missile with a range of 5,000 km that can be prolonged to 13,000, maybe even 20,000, km.
Observers believe that the improvement of relations between Teheran and New Delhi was caused by the crisis in Iranian-Pakistani relations that resulted from the difference between the two countries' views on the conflict in Afghanistan. While Pakistan supports the Taliban ruling regime in Kabul, India (sic) supports the opposition. The two countries also compete for the markets of Central Asia.

ISRAELIS KILL EGYPTIAN CITIZEN, DISMEMBER HIS BODY
Sources affirmed that the martyr received a bullet in his head splitting it into halves. He also received several bullets in his intestines tearing them apart and some other bullets in his legs.
The Egyptian Foreign Ministry presented a strongly-worded protest against the Israeli government voicing discontent at the killing of the Egyptian man with Israeli army bullets and calling for sending the killers to the Egyptian government to try them for their flagrant crime.
People's Assembly members with legal backgrounds are drafting two new bills on practicing political rights in Egypt and amendment of the law on the People's Assembly.
The experts will build their case on that the Constitution addresses general issues and leaves the details to laws, which must protect national security. The new political rights bill also aims at preempting the attempts for amending the nationality law in order to grant Egyptian citizenship to the children of Egyptian women who married foreign nationals, so as to put an end to the strenuous efforts that are currently being made for securing Egyptian citizenship to some 10,000 children born in marriages between Egyptian women and Arabs or foreigners, despite the fact that these children already carry the citizenship of their fathers.
The amendments of the political rights law and its executive regulation will also prescribe a new system for purging voter lists of the names of dead people and citizens who are prevented from practicing political rights by the law, such as military conscripts, policemen, Armed Forces personnel, judges and citizens who happen to be out of the country at the time of elections. They will require the Ministry of Interior to exercise additional care in compiling voter lists and have the lists computerized and the names typed correctly, so as to avoid the mistakes in the current lists, which had caused problems during elections. The period of voter registration will also be extended, so that it may last for the whole year.

Within the context of the plan of the American Chamber of Commerce in Egypt for boosting Egyptian exports, the first specialized office has been established in the United States in cooperation with the American Chamber of Commerce in Washington D. C. for promoting commerce and joint investments. The new office was given the name Forsa (Arabic for opportunity), signifying its main mission of finding opportunities for Egyptian and American companies to know their most likely partners and achieve mutual benefits from this cooperation, particularly in terms of boosting Egyptian exports to the United States and increasing American investments in Egypt in the fields of food industries, auto components and spare parts, franchises, information technology and software, all of which are considered as fields where Egypt has a good chance of becoming the main centre of exportation and attraction of foreign investments.
590 PALESTINIANS FELL MARTYRS IN INTIFADA UP TILL 1st JULY
The survey pointed out that injuries were concentrated in the legs at a rate of 25.3% and at a rate of 23% in the head and the neck. Gas inhalation constituted 15.5% and the upper part of the body represented 15.4%. Chest injuries constituted 7.5%, stomach and hip constituted 5.1%.
On 2 July, five Palestinians fell martyr with Israeli bullets including four in Jenin city and one in Gaza. The number of martyrs has thus risen to 590.
The explosion which was carried out by the Popular Front for Liberation of Palestine in Yahud district near Tel Aviv Airport and which resulted in the destruction of two cars and injury of a number of Jewish settlers, came in retaliation for the assassination of five strugglers from Hamas and Islamic Jihad. This explosion has very important political implications, shows the Palestinians' ability to penetrate Israel's security measures and reach deep areas in the occupied territories, and asserts that the unity of the Palestinian factions is no longer a slogan repeated in mass media and demonstrations.

Kuwait's Acting Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Sobah Al-Ahmed said there were no political reasons for the return of crown prince Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Sobah to Kuwait on July 2. The remarks were made by Sheikh Sobah in response to a question to this effect, dismissing any potential government reshuffle. "Sheikh Saad will not be a stumbling block to the governmental performance," he said. "The Crown Prince came back home after he completed his necessary check-ups."
He, moreover, considered that "Islamists play a favorable role in securing social balance in Kuwait." He also criticized some growing immoral aspects which come from abroad, terming them as "disintegration." "Islamists can voice their views in this spirit. They also can oppose to mixed universities (or co-education), just as this system's proponents."
On July 1, Israel mobilized its forces after Syria had launched a ground-to-ground Scud missile from Aleppo, according to the Israeli army.
Dawood Al-Shoryan wrote:
The Yahud operation is a piece of evidence that the so many names of the Palestinian resistance factions are mere synonyms of one meaning - resistance of occupation, and that the differences of the past ended in this era of uprising - the era of Jihad.
Sheikh Sobah was commenting on Saad's return from London, which was considered by milieus in Kuwait as being very early as he was expected to stay in London the whole summer.
Islamists noted that their relationship with Sheikh Sobah has become more balanced over the recent months. In the past, the Kuwaiti political dictionary distributed Islamists and liberals to Sheikh Saad and Sheikh Sabah respectively.
It is to be mentioned that in its previous sittings, the PA approved the bill and set the yesterday's sitting for approving it finally after being informed of Al-Azhar Grand Sheikh's opinion.
MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD DEPUTIES FILE 500 QUESTIONS, QUESTS FOR NOTIFICATION & INTERPELLATIONS IN PARLIAMENT
The performance of the Muslim Brotherhood representatives in the People's Assembly has reflected the diversity of their activities on the political and popular scenes. The deputies launched their activities only two weeks into the new parliamentary session by raising a hot issue that had made wide ripples in political and public circles, which involved three novels that had been published by the Cultural Palaces Authority and contained permissive texts that the Muslim Brotherhood branded as violating the traditions and religion of the Egyptian community. Through their handling of this issue, the Muslim Brotherhood scored much publicity, as their case was supported by several groups in the community that were spearheaded by Culture Minister Farouk Hosni, who dismissed the Chairman of the Cultural Palaces Authority and a number of senior Ministry of Culture officials who had been involved in the crisis.

IRANIAN OFFICIAL ASSERTS HIS COUNTRY'S KEENNESS ON DEVELOPING RELATIONS WITH EGYPT
These statements are the first Iranian reaction after the launching of the second mural of the murderer of the late Egyptian president in Teheran.
In his new album, Egyptian controversial singer Shaaban Abdel- Rahim turned into a political theoretician going beyond his limited contribution to the world of politics through his famous song "I like Amr Moussa and hate Israel" in his previous album.
He started his album with a message entitled "O America, America" in which he addressed the Americans and touched on President Mubarak's peace efforts.
Both countries have civilizational roots that are thousands of years old. They have almost equal volumes of natural resources, population, the rate of the young men to the whole people, and the level of the awakening experiment in the 20th century.
This weight of young men makes us ask about Egyptian young men's attitude, which retreated totally vis-à-vis the new state of businessmen that disdain the youths' rights to the country's wealth, role in changing it to the best, and right to lead a dignified, independent and free life.
On the other hand, our "senior" intellectuals should admit that they have failed to lead young men to the correct road. Egyptian intellectuals failed to play the most important role wanted by the homeland; they failed to fight.
AM/ Al-Quds Al-Arabi, 5/7/2001
Results proving the efficiency of new laws and legislation will be evident within the three coming years, the report said pointing out that the bulk of these laws have accumulative effect. The report was characterized by transparency and clarity as it admits to some pitfalls concerning performance. The agriculture sector was vulnerable to impacts of natural factors such as drought in the form of decrease of grain production. The results of analysis and evaluation of financial, material and human factors for the year 2000 showed that these factors were no better than those of 1999, and that the measures taken have not brought about any results yet, according to the report.
Excerpts of this article run to the following effect: The People's Assembly (PA) was deceived, and as a result it approved defective petroleum policies that took the oil sector to a tragic end. Instead of giving the State Treasury billions of dollars yearly, this sector became impotent and the State started to spend money on it!
2 - Egypt's reserve of crude oil will deplete quickly, as the foreign companies started to vie over prospecting for gas owing to the amendments.
Fourth Trick: 	The PA was deceived when it did not agree to grant the concession of prospecting for oil in the area of Ain Al-Mallah in Egypt's Eastern Desert to the Egyptian national firm - the General Petroleum Company - despite assertions that petroleum exists in this area. Dr. Ramadan Abul-Ela, a PA member and Head of the Science Department at the Faculty of Engineering, Suez Canal University, raised this issue.

But, since man is sociable by nature and therefore cannot live without affiliations or identity, some invented a model of their own which they called "Al-Rawshana", quite a new term that signifies a tendency not to conform to any traditional codes of behaviour, including language.

Unlike traditional sermon givers, he never discountenances self indulgence on the part of youth by looking askance at them or by disparaging or cursing their behaviour.

To them, he recommends the contemplative approach that fills the heart with adoration of Allah, the Creator, thus turning meditation into a most rewarding mental activity!

The fixed assets and equipment will also be appraised according to the book value, as a minimum.

"The raised ideas give independents rights equal to those of the parties and allocate seats to the individual system and others for the lists," Hussein Abdel-Razeq, Assistant Secretary General of the Leftist Grouping Party, told Al-Hayat. "These ideas also give room to the application of political coalition principle and provide for the formation of open lists without any condition. The rate of representation in the PA, then, is determined in light of the number of votes one gets inside the constituency," he added.
However, there is another tendency, which has a limited influence and calls for introducing more improvements to the electoral system that would enable all political trends to be widely represented in the country within the framework of political stability required for boosting economic reform.

Why?
Such a leap in private sector bids, nevertheless, did not last long, as there was a retreat once more in the next year, 1999 when the number of bids stood at only five, 19.2%. The greater retreat was in the next two years, though. While only one offer was offered in 2000, not a single offer has been witnessed in 2001.
The rise in the stock of Al-Misreya for Mobile Phone Services by 762% has, no doubt, altered the change rate average in the bidding price; thus turning the average into positive 3.1%, a rise rate in bidding price, whereas the decline rate average for 1997 reached 23.5% negative, 2.6% negative for 1999 and negative 17.4% in 2000, while 1998 average was 55.8% positive. Aggregate Economic Retreat, First to Blame: 	Experts and specialists in capital market think that all parties are to blame for the lukewarm relation between the private sector and the bourse and the retreat of its role in financing the private sector. However, they differ regarding the ordering of priorities and the relative importance of reasons.
The third reason as seen by Dr. Khalifa is connected with capital market management and is represented in overlapping statements and failure to commit oneself to the declared statements as what happened when selling the Suez Company Cement, Helwan Cement, the Egyptian-American Bank and Egypt for Hotels.
Repetition of the experiment would not work in the near future and a review and rectification of the errors made is inevitable in order to rebuild confidence between those companies and the investors on the bourse through promotion of transparency, candidacy and good performance.
One can invest in the bourse, if one has less than 20 pounds.

It is no longer negotiations for liberating the land and establishing a Palestinian State, which is our demand. It has become negotiations for softening the Jewish military towards armless Palestinians, so that they may have some mercy for their bodies, which they have to use as the only weapon for resistance.
During that decade, the concept of an Israel that poses a common threat to all the Arabs though may be in different degrees receded.
The Arabs, having abandoned the equation of Arab-Israeli balance of power, contented themselves with the formula of Arab backed peaceful solution by discrete several authorities in Palestine, Syria, Jordan or Lebanon!
The peace road has been blocked and the Israeli aggression aggravated reaching its peak under Sharon's government, while the Arab order's tools were resorting to international organizations, denunciation and trying to persuade and encourage Israel through the establishment of relations with this or that country!
It is an intermediary that cannot be fair, as its task is keeping down the uprising.

MOSES BIRTHDAY CELEBRATIONS
There is no reason why such information can not be true as there is a village called Qintair in Al-Hussaini district, Sharkia governorate which, according to Egyptian and foreign archeologists, is the birthplace of prophet Moses (PBUH). There is also a river called "Pharaoh Sea" used by the people of the village and the neighbouring hamlets for drainage purposes. According to those archeologists, that river is the place where prophet Moses had been thrown away (by his mother) when he was just a baby.
Strangely enough, that man bought a feddan adjacent to Pharaoh Sea in the name of an Egyptian employee. Jewish tourists began to visit the village. Three years ago, the National Bank of Egypt received a request from an Egyptian investor living in Holland for financing a project for Jewish religious tourism which would include the holding of an official birthday festival for prophet Moses in the village of Qintair and constructing installations and farms on an area of one hundred feddans.
MPs CALL FOR BANNING US CONGRESS MEMBER FROM ENTERING EGYPT
The MPs announced their support of the US Islamic organizations in their violent response to Tom Lantos.

INSUFFICIENT POSITIVE STEP
The Egyptian government bears big part of the responsibility for the state of the shameful paralysis, which dominates the Arab nation at present, because the Egyptian political, military, and human weight is totally frozen. This weight is not utilized in favor of Egypt firstly and the Arab nation secondly in order to face the Israeli crimes against human beings and sanctities in the occupied Arab territories.
Egyptian weakness before Israel led to the current state of paralysis in the Arab Homeland.
We appreciate Egypt's role and every drop of blood offered by Egyptian heroes at the yards of dignity to defend the Arab nation and its legitimate rights. However, the Israeli aggression did not stop and it threatens Egypt's stability, security and sanctities. The state of avoiding confrontation, exercised by the Egyptian government at present does not befit Egypt, its status or cultural heritage.
The ten-page note, a copy of which was obtained by Al-Hayat, contained 13 charges, leveled against former and current officials in Israel. These charges are punishable by the Egyptian law. The note included hundreds of documents, proving that these crimes were actually perpetrated.

MAHER AND THE WORN OUT DIPLOMACY
The Egyptian-Jordanian initiative did not get enough Arab support to constitute a strong diplomatic option applicable in the current Palestinian crisis.
Maher, nevertheless, may need to be reminded of the necessity to promote Egyptian-Sudanese relations and unify the political stances of Egypt, Syria, Lebanon and Palestine in the face of the Zionist State and I, therefore, call on him to urgently complete the reconciliation between Al- Asaad and Arafat.

Unprecedentedly on both the political and parliamentary arenas in Syria, the Damascene MP Mohammed Ma'moun Al-Homsi announced that he would go on hunger strike for a week with a view to "resisting the campaign of pressures and libel" which he said is launched against him.
He was reelected in the following legislative rounds.
The Syrian Minister of Finance, Mohammed Khalid Al-Mahayni had notified Al-Homsi three days ago that he had to pay about $1-million taxes for importing auto equipment between 1992 and 1995. This encouraged Al-Homsi to carry out the strike idea.

A sharp crisis cropped up during the past two days between the banks and the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) due to the dollar loans, obtained by clients and travel agencies.
Al-Wafd, 9/8/2001
The Banks Union sided with the banks against dollar borrowers. Chairman of the Legal Committee and legal adviser to the Banks Union Gamal Askar said the banks position is right from the legal and practical points of view.
Fayez underlined that the banks extend loans in foreign currencies to the projects that would turn profits in foreign currencies. Therefore, it is not logical for a project to be extended dollars while it would turn profits in the Egyptian pound as such a step is considered a gross banking violation.
He pointed out that the CBE would postpone the payment of bank compensations till the end of the year. He expected that the volume of losses would go down with the passage of time and the decrease of the US dollar exchange rate. He also expected that the CBE dollar exchange rate (415 piasters) predominance would peter out if the power of supply and demand was given free rein in the market.
He said the fixation of the central dollar rate of exchange at 415 piasters had not been based on accurate statistics. Rather, it was done haphazardly as a touchstone for probing the market and trying the system. He added that the problem does not lie in the dollar rate but rather in its availability.
The alternative to the passage of such legislation is the application of banking regulations. The regulations, which are nine in number, include the good knowledge of the client of each bank and his balance, and following and applying transparency and credibility systems in the banking performance.
Al-Abyadh said the meeting that was held with the Minister of Economy and Foreign Trade, Youssef Botrous Ghali had proven the importance attached by the State to exchange firms.

HAH, Al-Gomhouria, 9/8/2001
I want to join the party.
1-	On 11 October 1999, Dr Atef Ebeid's cabinet took the oath of office. The US dollar's exchange rate posted in that day's newspapers was LE 3.416 for buying and LE 3.419 for selling.
3-	National currency is not an idol to worship or a sacred cow that should never be touched.
Today, $ 100 equal LE 420.
The question is: Is this the last battle in the war between the Egyptian pound and the US dollar, and when will Dr Ebeid's cabinet succeed in developing and applying real and effective means for reinforcing the position of the national currency, specifically through the enhancement of exports, reduction of imports and maximization of existing foreign exchange resources and creation of new ones, which should be the foremost concern of any cabinet?
7-	A final question, and I am apologizing in advance if it might sound out of line by asking it: If the exchange rate of the Egyptian currency is deteriorating under an active government and an economic ministerial group that never sleeps but meets twice or three times weekly, what will it take to stabilize or hike this rate?

As for the details of action, it is up to businessmen as these are private matters and the office does not interfere in them except upon request. For example, if any problems crop up, the office would make some efforts to settle the disputes amicably. If the office fails to do so, legal course of action is resorted to.

The Guide General of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood Group, Mostafa Mashhoor, made a call to Muslim scholars in which he pointed out "what our Muslim kin in Palestine are suffering, including indiscriminate murder, siege, starvation, demolition of houses, scooping of fields, arrest and torture, until their life has turned into one catastrophe after another from the early 20th century to date." He also cited "what the State of Palestine (the Islamic endowment) has been subjected to, including usurpation, Judaization, and the attempts to demolish the Holy Al Aqsa Mosque to build the alleged Temple in its place, where the executive steps have so arrogantly started."
I do not believe, either, that I need remind you of the deeds of the Zionists' rabbis, who are spreading racism and hate, advocating murder and bloodshed and pushing the military and political leaderships of the usurping entity for committing injustice, plunder, and liquidating or driving a whole people out of its land.
The US Administration is monitoring indications that may take American-Syrian relations towards more estrangement and lack of coordination on regional issues and revive topics that had soured the ties between the two countries.
The sources revealed that Israel saw a benefit in the reinforcement of Syrian-American relations, particularly in the new era of President Bashar Al Assad of Syria.
However, it seems that American Jewish circles have not yet been informed of this new Israeli orientation, for they have persisted in their anti-Syria campaign in American fora and the anti-Syria Congress, which impedes the efforts of the Bush Administration for adopting a more effective policy for normalization of relations with Damascus.

Will the Egyptian private sector venture into the field of building nuclear reactors to generate electricity in order to face the expected shortage of traditional sources of energy, including petroleum and gas?
"If the private sector enters this field, it will make a real breakthrough, not only in terms of generating power, but also as a result of the use of nuclear power in the field of land-restoration, as nuclear power will be successfully used to operate water-desalination stations to supply water for reclaiming the deserts that represent over 94% of Egypt's area, particularly as water is the only thing needed for turning these arid areas into arable land," he explained.
The role played by big companies in building nuclear reactors created in an atmosphere of the competition between nuclear power and other sources of energy, particularly gas and petroleum."
"The attraction of this field for capital in particular lies in the desire to develop the industrial way of thinking in Egypt, which still revolves around conventional industries," he explained.
He added that the number of Egyptian scientists employed in that sector abroad is more than 500 scientists, adding that they could undertake the task of building and supervising the operation of medium and small reactors if the necessary funds could be raised for buying the reactors and their accessory equipment.
"The sun represents a source of permanent energy in Egypt that lasts for 300 days per year. Despite all the safeguards that are in place today, depending on nuclear energy is not economical, particularly if we compare the costs of generating kilowatt/hours of electricity throughout the life of a nuclear power station to that of generating the same units at a solar energy station," he said.
The study prepared by the Egyptian Exports Development Centre and of which the Kuwaiti News Agency (KUNA) was informed affirmed that the Arab commercial relations were still weak and the volume of trade exchange between Arab countries and the outside world hit about $320 billion including $291 billion with non-Arab countries while the total inter-Arab trade volume did not go beyond $29 billion.

M.Sh. Al-Ahram Al-Arabi, 11/8/2001
By a simple calculation, the 80 piasters rise in the dollar rate since the beginning of the year and so far led to a 13 billion and 600 million pounds rise in the import bill, which would overburden the State as it would impose on it a rise in the subsidy channelled into the basic goods.
He added that the ample chances he had granted to the Islamists as well as the Coptic file being dealt with by security bodies and Sadat's decree making the Pope the only representative of the Copts with the State all were really grave errors.
According to Hanna, a resolution of such a problem would involve the "setting up of a committee of elders comprising both Muslims and Christians to be affiliated to the Presidency reporting, directly to the President, real data on any problem and proposals of possible solutions without the presence of any Church representative on the committee.
Hanna expected that the Coptic Church would face labyrinths after the departure of Shenouda.
The Church has, therefore, to denote, right from now, the role of expatriate Copts in choosing the next Pope and whether they would have any agents or not?

Al-Eryan urged the government to stop interfering in the parties' internal affairs, so long as they compete within the framework of the Constitution and peaceful political practices. He said the government interference to suspend judicial rulings on the return of the Labour Party is a "wrong act" that encroaches on the integrity of partisan practices. He hoped that all parties would give freedom to all trends inside them. Even if two trends in a party differ, one of them should be allowed to establish a new party through which it practices its political platform.

After the Egyptian government raised the dollar rate of exchange to 415 piastres with a move margin of 3% in a bid to control the rate of exchange market and stop the retreat of the Egyptian pound before the dollar, many a businessman, economist and industrialist warned against the impact of such a step on the sectors of Egyptian industry and trade. The proponents of the move expected that the new system would lead to a boom in various economic activities, such as tourism; the cornerstone of the Egyptian economy because domestic goods and services would become cheap as they are valued by the foreign exchange rates. Contenders of the move, on the other hand, said that it would lead to undermining the purchasing power of the Egyptian pound which retreated by about 30% before the dollar, which would, consequently exacerbate inflationary rates and the recession in the Egyptian markets.
Managing Director of Viga Company for software, Tarik Radwan, said that if some sectors had not been affected by the rise in the dollar rate of exchange software sector would be the most affected by the new system. In addition to the state of recession and the weakness of the purchasing power predominant in the computer domestic market as a result of the rise in sets prices, even more recession would emanate from such a decision. He added that computers price would rise by 30% on average above the current price because the main components are all imported and paid for by hard currency. The screen prices had already risen, he added. A screen which used to be worth LE400 only a few days ago would now cost LE600.

DEBATE IN PEOPLE'S ASSEMBLY OVER CONSTITUTIONALITY OF DENYING WIVES THE RIGHT TO FILE ADULTERY SUITS AGAINST HUSBANDS
They pointed out that the texts that had been proposed so far aimed at insuring the implementation of the principle of equal punishment in cases where wives resorted to killing husbands to defend their dignity and very being when they caught them in the act of adultery, so that they might receive lenient sentences that would not reach the degree of the death penalty on the grounds that their behaviour was reflex action in a moment of anger that was generated by anger. Such treatment of wives would be similar to the sentences awarded husbands in the crimes that they committed in defence of their honour when they caught their wives in the act of adultery.
In an exclusive statement to Al Ahrar, the Labour Party Chairman pointed out that all that had happened was that he had seen some actions of a number of members of the Executive Committee as matters that warranted calling them to account, but no decision, or even a proposal for a decision, for dismissal had been made.

A: When a country is occupied and its unarmed people are subjected to siege, physical liquidation of its children, scorching of its fields, demolition of its homes and murder of its members, while international organizations and the international community do nothing to stop that aggression or protect that people from it, that people has the right to protect itself from the Zionist attacks and return the attacks of aggressors with everything at its disposal.
A: This issue is governed by the rules and regulations of the organization, which follows the Holy Quran, the Prophet's Sunna and the practices of the Worthy Ancestors in this and other issues.

105 FROM LABOR PARTY LEADERSHIPS ASK THE PARTY LEADER TO DEPOSE SUPPORTERS OF ALLIANCE WITH IKHWAN
The statement signatories charged Magdi Hussein and his supporters with breaching the main political and professional ethics deliberately causing schism among the party ranks and circulating accusations of treason and collaboration for those who differ with them in opinion outside the party and then inside it. They underlined that that group's retaining in their positions in the party is a danger that requires confrontation and accountability pointing to what they branded as errors of campaigns and confrontations launched by Al-Shaab newspaper against prominent Egyptian officials in the past years.
Two days ago, on the wake of the latest developments, Shukry made striking statements to different local dailies, asserting that the alliance with the Ikhwan Group was related to elections only, in a gesture to the 1987 parliamentary elections. He affirmed that what happened following those elections was a sort of coordination with the political forces that is done among the opposition parties.
While opposition Labour Party leader, Ibrahim Shukry temporarily backtracked from his decision to dismiss 11 leading figures who are Islamically oriented in his party, and announced a postponement of the matter till his return to Cairo, the party secretary general, Magdi Ahmed Hussein, one of those to be dismissed showed misgivings that a trick might be in store to calm the situations due to the strong political and popular reaction against the decision.
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's Political Advisor Usama al-Baz dismissed as ungrounded that his country may plan to close down its embassy in Tel Aviv, saying that closure would be in the interest of neither Egypt, Palestinians nor Arabs. There should be a link with the Israeli public opinion so that Egypt may voice its alarm over the Israeli government's actions, he argued.
MT / Asharq Al-Awsat, 14/8/2001
Though the visit ended a few days ago, Israeli comments and analyses have not ceased.
In fact, Arab-Turkish sensitivities or sometimes crises do conceal the fact that Turkey had invariably taken the part of the Arabs in major issues ranging from the rejection of partition of Palestine through voting for the Arabs in 1947 to the rejection of Sinai invasion in 1956, the rejection of the annexation of the lands occupied in 1967, the recognition of the PLO as the only legitimate representative of the Palestinians, and then the recognition of the Palestinian State as of the first day it had been declared in Algeria in 1988, the rejection of occupying Kuwait in 1990 and the demands that Iraqi forces be withdrawn and legitimacy be restored.
Now there is no reason why a close relation should not be established between Turkey and Arab countries. I may even contend that such relations have become essential to both sides. The Arabs may find them especially profitable, as they might freeze the Turkish alliance with Israel so that it might not assume further developments.
Three other power stations are being built, he said, indicating that the first lies to the Northwest of the Gulf of Suez and is due to be finished in the first quarter of 2003. The second and the third stations will be built in Sidi Kirir and East Port Said.

The statement was based on the fact that the party leader who is not in Cairo at present stressed that no decisions were issued in this regard.
MAHER: ISRAELI COLONIZATION ON PALESTINE'S TERRITORIES BREATHING ITS LAST
Israel's escalation of aggression against the Palestinian people and its increasing violence used against this people would augur the end of Israel.
Regardless of some Ikhwanite allegations that they by no means sought after leading the opposition, thus averting hard-line positions, especially on the part of the government that refuses to recognize Ikhwanite deputies as one integrated parliamentary bloc, indicators confirm the Group's attempts to get leadership in light of the remarkable retreat of other opposition parties, especially what happened to the Wafd Party, which used to lead the opposition with its seven deputies at the beginning of the parliamentary session. After that, the Wafd deputies declined to four following the dismissal of two and the resignation of one.
Some Ikhwanite deputies said that the fact that a government minister had mentioned that is sufficient evidence of confidence in the Group's good performance and neutrality when dealing with controversial issues they put forward in the last parliamentary session, which emphasizes their right to have an independent parliamentary body away from the classification of Ikhwanite deputies as "independents."
He said that he had spent many years in Israeli prisons due to his activity. "I am now able to sacrifice my life for the sake of my religion and homeland," he added.

This is, perhaps, the first time homosexuals raise the slogan of international solidarity following the appeal addressed by a certain Faysal Allam who heads an alleged union called "the Muslim Homosexuals" in the USA where he called on his fellows in the world to show "solidarity with their persecuted companions" in Egypt.
Surprisingly, the Congressmen's letter implied a threat of withholding the American aid to Egypt as it started with these words: "Given we are among the avid supporters of offering aid to Egypt, we protest against putting homosexuals to trial and believe that indicting men who had sex with other men with their compliance is an act that we can neither defend nor explain."

SYRIA NEGOTIATES WITH RUSSIA TO BUY S300 MISSILES
In reply to Al-Hayat question about the likelihood of Russia being subjected to political pressure to prevent it from concluding weapons deals with the region's countries, Beladenov said that "Rus Aberden Export" worked within the framework of legitimacy and abided by international covenants.
Beladenov, nevertheless, declined to answer the question regarding Russia's providing Syria with S300 missiles, which matches Patriot missiles and which Russia had declined to export to Damascus, following strong Israeli objections.
According to a military expert, such a decision would have to be passed by the political leadership and ruled out the possibility of its being announced then on the eve of the visit to be paid to Moscow by Israeli premier Sharon on September 3rd.
In a step reflecting the state the Egyptian-Israeli relations reached, Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher, ignoring the diplomatic protocol, refused to bid farewell to the Israeli ambassador in Cairo on the occasion of the termination of his tour of office in Cairo.

The liberalization of trade, according to the study, can be achieved through hammering out more bilateral trade agreements.
DECISION TO REMOVE HIGOUMEN FROM PRIESTHOOD SCRAPPED
MT / Al-Mussawar, 17/8/2001
The report said that during the 1990's, with the beginning of the settlement process in Madrid in 1991, it was believed that war possibilities had waned in favour of peace turning into a strategic or even the only option for all parties. In 2000, however, once more war climates dominated the Middle East quite unprecedently compared with the 1990's standards. This has been largely due to armed interactions in the Arab Israeli conflict circle and the continued development of military power by the conflict parties.
Both the Palestinian and the Israeli negotiator in Camp David did invoke their individual cultural, religious, and historical heritages whether Islamic, Arab for the Palestinians on the one hand who cannot exclusively decide on the issue of Jerusalem or the Jewish perspective to Jerusalem on the other hand which is based on the slogan Judaism would be meaningless without Israel the state which would in turn be meaningless without Jerusalem that would be meaningless without the temple.
The wearing away of political cohesion and harmony between citizens against a growth of other non-political links, let alone political instability virtually rather than formally which is based on repression, bribery, legal formality, which turns the possibility of a sudden change into a very strong one.
3)	The attempt to develop Arab region order institutions through an Arab summit mechanism and economic integration.
The second negative point is the fact that the Arab world is lagging behind when it comes to modern concepts and techniques for achieving security, as it still relies on traditional techniques that focus on armament and high defensive expenditure.
Regarding the first point, the report sees that most of the region's countries adopt intensive armament policies and witnesses a state of arms race. The main reason for that is Israel's role. The Israeli defense policy relies on the necessity to take into account the possibilities of a break out of an all-out war not only against each Arab country alone but against them in toto and even taking into consideration the possibility of involvement in an extensive confrontation against a military alliance of Arab and Islamic states including Iran and Pakistan, etc. it is therefore, planning to ensure the superiority of the Israeli army over all Arab and Islamic armies together.
Major countries in the region have topped high on the list of arms purchases between 1994 and 1998, a tendency which is unlikely to change in the near future even if a peace settlement was reached with the Hebrew state.
-	The absence of parties and return of Muslim Brotherhood. Parties in toto have won fewer seats than Muslim Brotherhood alone, (which won 17 seats). The group has run the elections quite efficiently, which raised their number to be the only equivalent of the independents who used to be the first power in these elections as the independents got 232 seats before joining the National Party whose official win stood at 172 seats (388 after 216 independents joined it). The Islamic trend got 19 seats, 17 of which were won by the Ikhwanites. Al-Wafd Party won 7 seats and the leftist grouping got 6 seats. The Nasserite party won 2 seats.
EU URGES EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT TO SPEEDILY ADOPT ANTI- LAUNDERING LAW NEXT MONTH
An official source at the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) said an anti-laundering legislation does not run counter to confidentiality of bank accounts.
This legislation should lead to eradicating the awfully limited laundering operations, he added, pointing to existing controls such as the anti-illicit gain act.
During the coming few days the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) will consider pegging the Egyptian pound to a basket of currencies.
Board member of the National Bank of Egypt, Abbas Samaha underlined the necessity of hastily pegging the pound to a basket of currencies including the euro, the dollar and the yen pointing out that the rise of the euro price against the dollar represents a big support for the pound and precipitates carrying out the basket of currencies.
The CBE continued to cover the uncovered financial positions and has not stopped meeting the banks' needs since the new mechanism of the central price was put into practice, he said noting that the CBE had pumped 41.5 million US dollars into the National Bank of Egypt till the end of transactions of Thursday August 16.

He added that all the remaining quotas in the public enterprise companies that had been privatized were put up for sale and the Holding Companies that own these quotas were ready to receive the purchase offers from investors and investment funds.
Measures related to the sale of the offered quota of the Misr for Hotels ( Hilton) are now being virtually taken and will be put forward to the Board of Directors of Holding Company for Housing, Tourism and Cinema, he revealed.
Voices have raised calling for stopping the privatization program on the basis that the government undergoes a sharp liquidity crunch which means that offering more public assets in light of the deteriorating condition of the market would lead to a decline in their prices with foreigners being the potential buyers as long as there is a liquidity crisis in the country.
Washington asked the Arab parties with which the negotiations are conducted, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates, not to call for having Israel condemned, well-informed diplomatic sources said. Washington also asked the Arabs not to call for the deployment of international observers except upon approval by the Palestinians and Israel, said the sources, adding that this will be in return for non-exercise by Washington of the power of veto. Washington proposed that the Security Council would issue a presidential statement, urging the Palestinian and Israeli sides to halt violence in the occupied territories.
SYRIA AND THE WAITING SCENARIO!
Israel is occupying Palestinian and Syrian lands. The military front inside the occupied lands in Palestine is on fire and therefore the Palestinian cause would suffer no harm if a front, that may be only political, was opened. It may even intensify pressure on Israel regionally and internationally.
Commenting on the Israeli occupation of the Orient House, Usama Saraya, chief editor of Al-Ahram Al-Arabi writes this article which runs to the following effect only in part:
What does he think himself doing by withdrawing the recognition of the legitimacy of the Palestinian Jerusalem? Inhabitants presence in the capital of Old Jerusalem.
Ashraf Ammar, an Egyptian citizen, writes in Al-Ahrar to say:
But Syria did not go to war (with Israel) for the sake of its Golan Heights so how can it wage war for Palestine?
But it is the Jordanian regime itself which set a bloody massacre for the Palestinians in the famous black September of 1970.
But Lebanon has just got out of the civil war and guerilla warfare to liberate the southern territories and is locked in many problems, particularly as the sectarian dossier has not been closed so far. Moreover, the wounds sustained from old wars have not been healed and the problematic relationship between the Islamic resistance movement of Hizbullah and the legitimate government is still existent and the Syrians presence and Maronite Christians fear can not be shrugged off or ignored.
According to the Egyptian leadership, the idea of waging war is demagogical, and a thing of the past and does not have any amount of political logic.

This requires efforts to redress the present Arab- Israeli military balance to face the mad force of the Israeli community, which threatens the neighboring countries, including the ones that rejected peace deals with Israel.

Al-Wahsh became widely known by dint of the case he had filed against writer Nawal Al-Saadawi asking for having her separated from her husband on grounds that she "denied religious constants." Although he lost the case, Al-Wahsh promised to pursue the judicial struggle against her until he separated her from her husband.
Surprisingly, there are living people who asked to make a statement about a tangible substantial incident related to the killing of martyr Bilal Mukhttar Al-Rawi. They affirmed that Al-Rawi fared well in the 1956 war in the face of the Israeli occupation in Sinai and he walked on foot along with an array of his buddies to Port Said where they were all beleaguered and arrested by the French occupation forces. When a French officer asked Al-Rawi to take off his clothes, he refused and slapped him on the face. The French separated him from his buddies and killed him.
Egypt's food production totaled about 73 million tons annually, including agricultural, animal and piscine food. According to international standards, this quantity meets or rather exceeds the population needs by 23%.
It is common knowledge that there is over-consumption in food in Egypt, due to certain food habits. The kind of food goes up in proportion to economic and social levels. The waste also aggravates on certain occasions such as weddings and feasts.
Leave rulers alone, leave their ridiculousness alone, their envoys, their hesitations, as they know what we know. They know they are playing in the injury time and are defending chairs that about to collapse, and defending their existence, which is actually nil. They have reached senility on their chairs and their scepters which they brandish in the air were eaten up by ants a long time ago, leaving them just as helpless as logs of wood so that they might seem to some alive, but are in fact dead! Leave them alone, as we no longer need them! We no longer seek in them a support or standby, nor do we expect of them some traces of conscience, as we lost hope in corpses coming back to life.

According to the report, Lebanon topped the list of the Egyptian potato importer countries by a percentage of 79.3% of the total exported quantities followed by Kuwait 13.1%, Oman 2.8%, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) 1.7% and Saudi Arabia came last with imports put at 1.4%.
The report expected an increase in the quantities of potato exports to Europe in the new season as the European Committee approved 24 areas whose production is appropriate for exportation and whose space stands at 32 thousand feddans.
This came in a report, received by Minister of Economy and Foreign Trade Youssef Boutros Ghali from the Egyptian Commercial Representation Office in Bucharest. The report dealt with the developments of the trade movement between Egypt and Romania during the first half of this year.
CUSTOMS DUTIES UP & DOWN ACCORDING TO DOLLAR RATE
He denied what had been reported that customs duties would be fixed after they had been equalized with Egyptian pound according to the new dollar rate of exchange. Fixing customs duties is subject, in the first place, to the date of registering certificates or customs bill. At this date, the dollar rate is counted, and this is the currently valid system, he said.
It has been decided to transfer foreign exchange deposits of the companies affiliated to the Public Enterprise Sector in Egyptian banks to the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE). Any balance accounts in foreign exchange will no longer be held unless urgently needed, provided that the CBE meets these companies' needs at any time in any quantities, according to the decision.

As per the cabinet's decisions, any defaulting client has the right to ask the bank he is affiliated to for rescheduling his loans at the same prevailing interest rate at the time when he got his loan to be rescheduled, said an official source with the head office of the Development and Agricultural Credit Bank. Agricultural banks are not willing to take any legal action against their serious clients, the source pointed out. The banks always seek to provide more facilities for their clients as long as there are seriousness and readiness on the part of the client to repay their loans. Repayment rates among those who deal with the Development and Agricultural Credit Bank hit more than 95% of the volume of the given credit.
A report released by the Egyptian Cotton Exporters Union in Alexandria said the decline in the Egyptian cotton exports is attributed to the sharp competition between the Egyptian cotton and the American pima cotton.

The report pointed out that the Egyptian nationality law of 1995 regulates the naturalization of Egyptians, who should keep their Egyptian nationality due to basic considerations mainly including the reassurance of Egyptian expatriates.
IKHWANITES DENY ANY RELATION WITH FROZEN WIFAQ PARTY
Such reports are fabricated and groundless, he pointed out. Dr. Rifaat Al-Agroudi, one of the contestants for the Wifaq Party leadership, told Al- Hayat that the reasons for convening a party general congress and the exclusion of its leadership included their tendency to forge an alliance with the Muslim Brotherhood and Labor Party.
Although the Muslim Brotherhood was careful to avoid any official treatment of the Labor Party crisis and Group leading figure Dr. Essam Al-Eryan, affirming that the Group had no relation with what was going on in the Labor Party, he said that the Group calls on all parties to dialogue and help the Party out of its crisis.
The freeze decision was made at an emergency meeting held by the CPP on August 19. At the meeting, the CPP also suspended Al-Qarar paper, the mouthpiece of the National Wifaq Party, owing to a dispute over the chairmanship of the party between Ahmed Shuhib, the party leader, and his rival Refaat al-Agroudi a party secretariat member.
Shuhib termed a decision not to recognize any of the parties disputing over the party chairmanship until an amicable or judicial settlement is reached between them as a sovereign decree which violates the law and constitution.
Agroudi accused Shuhib of preparing for hammering out an alliance with the Muslim Brotherhood in a bid to reverse the party's progressive line to Islamic orientations, arguing that all this violates the party's principles and platform, a main reason for freezing the party, he added.

Nakhla admitted that that might spark the hostility of the Islamic trend. The third is that the association will not take either action, which will then prove its siding with a particular trend.
Egyptians spend LE56 billion on food and drink annually, pointed out some statistics of the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics for 2000.
A poor family average spending on food hits 62% of their total expenditure, or the equivalent of LE2,874 annually, points out a study entitled "Family and Social Spending" issued by the National Center for Social Research in 2000 under the supervision of Dr Sohair Lotfi on 2507 families representing governorates of Cairo, Menufia, Daquahlia, Fayyoum, Damietta, Menya, and Sohag. A middle-class family on average spends 56% of their income on food, or the equivalent of LE7172 annually, while rich families spending on food goes down to hit 42% of the average total of the family's annual expenditure, or the equivalent of LE6362, according to the study.
THE ENIGMATIC STATE & THE THEORY OF THE MAXIMUM GAINS!
Second, trying to cut the Palestinian demands to size. Throughout history, the Israelis have shown great ingenuity in getting the maximum and letting the Arabs pant for the minimum. The current Israeli government, intoxicated by excessive feelings of power and aggression, believes it can impose on the Palestinians formerly un-thought of capitulation by creating a situation, which makes any handouts from Israel an entirely welcome balm after such hard times. Under such a delusion of power, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres once proposed to create a Palestinian State in Gaza alone in a malicious attempt to get Israeli gains in the exceptional circumstances of the conflict.
This time, however, the big difference lay in the size of Palestinian valor and the unprecedented caravans of martyrdom, which expresses Palestinians' absolute rejection of life itself if it is linked with humiliation and degradation created by Israel.
3 - The Arab mass media discourse is still hesitant. It either gives vent to feelings or gives voice to aspirations, but it never touches upon the crux of the conflict in a way that can be palatable to other parties that are either distant or nonchalant. Even though we quite appreciate and give credit to new efforts to develop the content of Arab mass media, we have yet to go a long way!
Second, taking an Arab diplomatic collective action with the USA. For instance, Arab foreign ministers could hold extensive meetings with the US Administration and Congress in Washington, provided their discourse adopts a new political language, quite different from any previous Arab discourse.
I can see, however, that the basic calculations for the national interest call us for a genuine Arab reconciliation to be exploited in pressuring both the USA and Israel.
42% INCOME TAX ON NET PROCEEDS OF HONEST INVESTOR!
As a result, huge numbers of taxpayers evade paying taxes.
As for "extortions and fees," which come under the seventh group of the First Chapter (sovereign proceeds) of the State Budget, they include the so-called "resource development taxes" that, in turn, have 16 finance bases. No Egyptian can evade paying these charges because they are paid side by side with the stamp tax. Mr. Atta says that in addition to the "stamp tax" paid whenever an application is presented to a government body, and the "stamp tax" paid whenever one cashes a sum of money, exceeding one pound, from the government, one also pays a relative stamp tax on bank accounts, which hits 0.003% of the account value.
The value of indirect taxes, imposed by the government on citizens, hits 66% of the total taxes.

Egyptian banks on August 22 embarked on a new reduction of interest on dollar loans. The reduction hit 0.25% on average, the equivalent of the American Central Bank reduction of interest rates on short- term loans made on 22 August to 3.5%.
Regeh also expressed his reservations concerning the retreat in proceeds undergone by Egypt's foreign reserves in light of the new reduction of interest rates. He described this retreat as a slight one. It is international exchange rates rather than interest rates that affect these reserves, he added pointing out that the Egyptian authorities should move towards the euro in light of the strikes directed to the dollar during the last period.
Prominent economist, Hazim Al-Beblawi said the Egyptian economy had lost more than $7 billion during the last period due to fixing the rate of exchange.
The second crisis took place late January last when the dollar jumped to LE3.91 while it was being sold on the black market at more than LE4.20. The government was in full knowledge of this", Al-Beblawi said.
This should be conditional on changing these currencies from time to time according to the positions of trade and investment and Egypt's international relations.
The simple annual growth rate of the public domestic debt, even if inflation rate is excluded, fantastically exceeded the growth rate of the real GDP, the study indicated. This represents a dangerous axis that may pose threats to the public financial situation as this rate hit 9% in 1994/95, 12.3% in 1996/97, then rose to 13.4% in 1998/99, but it went down to 11% in 1999/2000, according to the study. The danger lies in the fact that the public debt may acquire the characteristic of automatic growth even if the government extends new loans as the repayment of the debt installments and interest will result in more loans, something which may destabilize the public financial situation, the study pointed out. Therefore, financial policy-makers should take into account that the public domestic debt would not exceed the GDP growth rate.
The reason behind the drop of inflation rate is attributed to the fact that throughout the 90s, there was a shrinking tendency despite the trials for bringing about a boom faced by the aggravation of trade balance deficit and pressure on exchange rate. The shrinking tendency naturally brings about positive effects regarding the inflation rate and the percentage of budget deficit to the GDP and trade balance deficit. The study further warned against the adoption of models designed by the IMF that see that a shrinking financial and monetary policy should be adopted for achieving stability or economic stability without conducting any sufficient study on the extent of effects these policies may have on the all-out economic variables such as the product level, employment level as this may lead to gross problems in light of inconvenient economic conditions.

NO FOREIGNERS ALLOWED TO BUY SINAI-BASED PUBLIC ENTERPRISE COMPANIES
Why are not these companies sold to a government body or an Egyptian holding company as was the case with Damanhour Carpets, and Ramses Agricultural companies which were sold to Al-Awqaf Authority, and Tora Fertilizers which was sold to Suez Cement in order that the ownership of these companies may not be transferred to foreigners, especially as the Holding Company for Chemical Industries decided to put up Sinai Company for Manganese for sale late this year. Although Sinai Company for Manganese is the pressing case, there are other companies operating in Sinai such as Al-Nasr for Salinas in Sebeika and other travel agencies.

The assembled brotherhood members went out on demonstrations after the Friday congregational prayer, expressing their desire to support the Intifada and participate in the holy struggle against Israel.
We are telling the whole world from the courtyard of Al Azhar Mosque that no force, whatever it may be, will separate the Muslims from their Al Aqsa Mosque. Israel should realize that the Muslims will not remain silent towards the massacres that victimize their brothers in Palestine. The Israeli Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon, should realize that the Egyptian people is determined to liberate Palestine and that Arab peoples will unite someday to stand against him. The United Nations should realize that its continuous failure to act and its submission to American domination will not erode the resolve of Arab and Muslim peoples."

ISRAELI COUP IN LEBANON FOILED
The Israeli coup was planned after Ariel Sharon's assumption of power in Israel. An intelligence report revealed that coordination meetings were held in Paris by the head of the former military government of Lebanon, Brigadier Michel Aoun, Al Hendi, Lubrani and representatives of Syrian opposition groups and Jewish organizations in Europe for staging acts that would destabilize the Lebanese and Syrian scenes, provoke European, particularly French, media into defaming the two countries and souring the strategic relationship between them, which would serve the Israeli scheme for undermining internal unity and triggering further economic deterioration.
The Nile flood this year has been ferocious to an extent the like of which happened only 123 years ago, specifically in 1878, when the Nile flooded both Sudan and Egypt in a natural disaster that is almost repeating itself now in Sudan and may reach Egypt at any time. Everybody knows that August and September come unfailingly at the same time every year; everybody except the Egyptian Ministry of Irrigation in the early 21st century.
The water is now more than Lake Nasser can handle, the Toshki Drain pours the water back into the Nile and the Western Sahara Reservoir is shared by four countries, namely Chad, Libya, Egypt and Sudan. In other words, our water exposes us to danger twice: once when it sweeps over the Nile Valley to drown it, and again when it goes to waste in the desert. In both cases, the Egyptian Ministry of Irrigation lives in its own world that is isolated from the other world that is addressed by scientific studies. We must revive the research works from the crypts they are buried in.

PARLIAMENTARIANS PREPARE NEW BILL ON POLITICAL PARTIES
The PA members, including Al-Badri Farghali, Saber Abdel-Sadeq, Ali Fateh Al-Bab and Abul-Ezz Al-Hariri, asserted that the government imposes full control over partisan life in Egypt and kills democracy and the multi-party system via two main points. First, it imposes a pure government formation, which lacks neutrality, on the CPPA, whose members include the Ministers of Justice, the Interior and PA Affairs, in addition to pro-government public figures.
It will be difficult in light of restrictions laid down by the law in its current status to codify the conditions of political trends that already exist in the society, he added.
Meanwhile, Al-Badri Farghali, PA member representing the Grouping Party, and Hamdein Sabbahi and Abdel-Azeem Al-Maghrabi, two PA members belonging to the Nasserite Party, reject the existence of the CPPA, saying that it has already killed partisan life in Egypt.
The problem is that although Copts can get a divorce from personal status courts for ten reasons that were set forth by a regulation that was passed in 1938 and is dubbed as "the merciful regulation" in Coptic circles, the Church refuses to recognize this regulation and its resultant divorces and requests for second marriages. Pope Shinouda has insisted on applying the biblical text that prohibits divorce except in cases of adultery, while the regulation lists ten reasons for divorce, including adultery, desertion, estrangement, impotency, madness and terminal illness.
He also said in his memorandum that the decision to revoke his status was null and void because it lacked the prerequisite just procedures.

This urged researchers and engineers to think of equatorial lakes at the Nile sources as they are giant natural reservoirs that can be made use of through building dams at the water outlets, thus converting them into permanent reservoirs to be resorted to for hundreds of years so that Egyptian and Sudanese ordinary requirements are released through dams built for that purpose.
However, this attempt failed on the ground that this subject could be raised at the level of an Arab summit, not at the level of foreign ministers, he told Asharq Al-Awsat.
The meetings of the Arab foreign and information ministers did not probe any issues related to military actions, as these actions fall within the competence of the Arab summit, which should adopt such firm decisions, Qaddomi said.

Al-Wafd, 28/8/2001
However, this should never be taken to mean submission to world Zionism and the American scheme for undermining the Arab regional order: our generation and its leaders should resist, carefully conducting a low-intensity conflict against Israel by all the Ring Countries and the significant Arab countries that are not adjacent to Israel. This conflict should include political and diplomatic pressure, economic boycott of Israel at all levels, severance of all ties and contacts with the so-called peace advocates in the accursed Zionist state, psychological warfare against the barbaric people of Israel, encouragement and support with arms and combat experience to the active resistance against occupation forces, occupiers and settlers and participation in active and passive intelligence activities in the depth of the Hebrew state. Support to the second Palestinian Intifada must continue, too, as should the rejection of a conditional truce during which the colonizing settlement on the West Bank of the River Jordan and the threatening Jerusalem would continue until the months of the truce are wasted one after the other in alleviating the tension and building the so-called confidence between Arafat and his colleagues on the one hand and Sharon and his terrorist gang on the other, or in examination of the "Gaza first" option that was proposed by late President Anwar Al Sadat in Camp David in 1979, only to be rejected by Yasser Arafat, who committed a grave mistake against Palestine and its people by refusing it.

Belly dancer Fifi Abdou recently received a lucrative offer for training a number of Israeli girls in belly dancing.

THE MIRAGE OF MEDIATION
Its is now time to recognize facts that only those who blindfold themselves cannot see, including that mediation requires a neutrality the United States does not have and that neutrality requires the approval of both the parties between which the mediation is made, while Israel wants to keep Washington as a party to the conflict and send off any other mediator in which it suspects the slightest degree of integrity or fairness.
These facts have never been invisible, but the thing that George Bush is to be thanked for is his frankness, which embarrasses those who still insist that the sun can rise from the west and that the United States can still take care of the interests of the Arabs to protect its own interests in their countries.

It seems, during the latest years, that we have been accustomed to problems whether cotton production increased or decreased.
Al-Mo'taz Bellah Abdel-Maqsoud, President of the Holding Company for Cotton, Spinning and Weaving, says in light of conditions on international markets and shrinkage in exportation, the local spinneries will be unable to purchase cotton this season at export prices, from which the preparation prices are deducted. Besides, international cotton prices plummeted during the recent months, and expectations that the prices of Egyptian cotton exports will go down will not positively affect spinneries due to the rise in the dollar rate against the pound. Spinneries ask for purchasing Upper Egypt cotton - the two types of Giza 80 and 83 - at a price of 55 cents per libra, i.e. LE252 per kantar instead of LE268 last year, he says. The spinneries also propose to buy Lower Egypt cotton at the export prices, from which 10% is deducted, he says.
Although the spinneries ask for that, Amin Abaza, Head of Cotton Exporters' Union, says this matter is of concern to the government alone, and this will not affect the export prices. He expects that cotton export prices, which will be announced late September 2001, will be decreased at a rate ranging between 10% and 15% to cope with nosedives in cotton international prices. Besides, Egyptian cotton is facing a fierce competition from the American pima cotton, whose supply hits about two million kantars for exportation.
Excitingly, Dr. Dahmoush says Egypt's exports incur losses because Egypt's products depend on Egyptian cotton, whose prices are high. Had he been responsible for the cotton field in Egypt, he would have imported cotton necessary for spinneries from abroad, he points out.

A number of the overall economic indications cited in the monthly report issued by the Cabinet's Information and Decision Support Centre reflect the state of recession in the Egyptian economy, while other indications show negative effects of this state of stagnation on other sectors, despite the fact that, put together, the overall indications place the Egyptian economy in a good position among those of developing nations. The rate of growth of the Egyptian GDP has reached 6.5%, coming next to that of China, whose GDP growth rate reached 7.8%, and very far in front of that of Turkey, which came at the bottom of the list with a GDP growth rate of -1.9%.
However, the most important development pointed out by the report is the sharp deterioration of direct and indirect investments in the Egyptian economy, either through the establishment of companies or the subscription to companies' shares on the Stock Exchange. According to the Cabinet's Information and Decision Support Centre, the number of companies that were established during the period from January to July 2001 totaled 1,697, while the number of companies established during the same period of 2000 was 2,052.

The committee comprised the Director General of Registration in the Ports and Lighthouses Authority, an engineer and a legal expert.
He stressed the importance of exempting services activities from taxes for supporting productive sectors and reducing production costs, as factories had to shoulder heavy burden to take their workers to and from work. The minister also explained that exemptions and facilities were extended to projects after consideration of the sovereign resources that went to the development of education, health and other services.

This admittance was voiced by some Jewish teaching staff and academicians at the two universities of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv on the heels of demonstrations staged by students in defense of their Palestinian professors, who work in Hebrew universities and were deposed from their leading posts and banned from being nominated for occupying such posts in the future. Besides, Palestinian labor inside the universities was shrunk on the pretext of preserving Israeli security, although those Palestinian professors have the Israeli nationality.

Deputies including Al Badri Farghali, Ezz Mostafa, Farouk Metwalli, Al Sayed Al Sherif, Atef Al Ashmuni and Sayed Rostom criticized the disagreement in government circles over the antitrust bill, whose presentation to the People's Assembly has been delayed for about three years during which the government had made several promises to speed up the passage of the bill to face up to one of the negative effects of globalization and the adoption of free market mechanisms.
The study indicated that one of the ways to monopoly was to acquire a concession from the government for producing a certain commodity for a given period of time in the absence of another entity to compete with the concessionaire before the end of that period.
The study also pointed out another phenomenon that is worthy of study, namely privatization. Despite the fact that the declared purpose of privatization is to create a competitive environment for enhancing efficiency, redistributing resources and improving performance, this process had resulted in monopolies in several sectors, including the cement production sector, where a number of foreign companies now control the market. The same applies to the durable goods sector, where Olympic Group bought out the shares of Ideal Company, five million in all, and now controls 80% of the market of oil-filled radiators, 65% of the market of washing machines, 65% of the market of water heaters and 55% of the market of refrigerators.

Concerning government measures for supporting farmers and domestic production, the report indicated that China subsidizes its local prices by a sum higher than market levels. Thus, the cutback of this subsidy may lead to the reduction of its production. Mexico, Brazil, Egypt and Turkey are characterized by having a modest programme for subsidizing cotton farmers. Early this year, Egypt announced facilities in the stage of production for farmers. They will be given a 176-pound facility in payment per cotton-planted feddan.
The report, referred to the government, warned against the continuation of wasting water in Egypt at a time when studies affirmed that Egypt had fell under water poverty line three years ago.

Eng Sayed Ismail, Deputy Chairman of the Egyptian Association of Computer Manufacturers, said that computer prices had gone up by about 15% because the computer industry was still in the assembly phase and most computer components were imported from abroad. Such a situation threatened the industry with stoppage, he added, after the government had spent much time and money on promoting the production and usage of computers everywhere in Egypt. The increase in computer prices would also reduce sales, which had already undergone a remarkable slump since early July as a result of the application of the second and third phases of the sales tax that had resulted in a 20% drop in sales, he explained, pointing out that the new situation would add further burdens to the local industry and render it more incapable of competition with imported computers, even leading to closure of factories and laying off of workers.

The latest report on human development by the National Planning Institute revealed that there is a deficiency in human development of 38% and placed Egypt 119th among 174 countries in the United Nations classification of human development. Canada came first with a deficiency of only 7%, while Sierra Leone came last with 75%. However, Egypt has progressed much during the last quarter of the 20th century, as its human development indicator in 1975 was only 0.43.
It also indicates that 47.3% of Egyptian adults are illiterate. This is a high percentage, especially if we take into account that in countries like Togo, Tanzania and Zambia, the percentage of literate citizens is higher than it is in Egypt. Apparently, the Egyptian government needs to give more attention to education, given its critical role in expanding the base of human wealth and achieving economic growth, not to mention the fact that the Egyptian Constitution stipulates that all Egyptians without exception are entitled to free education.

Al-Wafd, 11/9/2001
In a study on Israeli strategy for cooperation with Arab countries in the field of petroleum, Hammuda says that the Israeli expansion of the oil pipeline is aimed at attracting as much Iranian crude as possible to the Israeli pipeline instead of the Suez Canal and SUMED pipeline and erecting a number of storage projects for storage crude for customers. He explains that the stored crude would be released on the market quickly at times of high demand to avail the high prices, pointing out that the services rendered through the pipeline will be developed in such a way that the marketing management of the Israeli pipeline will contract for carrying the oil through the pipeline from export ports to Ashkelon, from which it will be exported to western and northern consumers on Israeli tankers. Israel will provide tanker refueling and crude storage services free of charge to permanent customers, which could make international oil-trading companies use the Elat- Ashkelon pipeline for carrying crude, particularly from Iran, and even high-sulfur Egyptian crude, such as that produced at Ras Badran and Ras Gharib, as SUMED pipeline is designed to carry only low-sulfur crude.
It revealed an Israeli strategy for normalization of relations with Arab States in the field of oil and gas production, indicating that that strategy comprised several axes, including building a pipeline network for carrying Arab crude through Israel and erecting a number of refineries in cooperation with Arab countries. The strategy aimed at making Israel the centre for collecting and exporting natural gas in the region, which would pose a serious challenge to Arab development in general and the Arab oil and gas industry in particular, the study warned.
Sameh Rashid, an Egyptian writer and scholar, wrote an article in Al Hayat under this title, saying: Baghdad has covered much ground during the past year in terms of breaking the air embargo and the economic blockade imposed on it, signing several commercial exchange agreements and restoring diplomatic relations with several Arab countries, some of them in the Gulf.
In Arab terms, this rapprochement between Baghdad and Damascus carries important implications for what is described in official Arab circles as the "Iraqi- Kuwaiti Case." Al Assad's visit to Kuwait was accompanied by optimistic speculations on a Syrian role for bringing the Iraqi and Kuwaiti viewpoints closer.
Within the same context, the Israeli-Turkish axis had an important effect on the developments currently taking place in the Fertile Crescent area. The progress of relations between Baghdad and Damascus must not be examined separately from the constant improvement of relations between Tel Aviv and Ankara. In this respect, we must remember the visit by Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to Ankara a month ago, which was locked in top secrecy that some analysts tried to explain as being motivated by Israeli preparations for a military confrontation in which Syria might be one of its parties - a matter that would certainly require coordination with Turkey. This sort of interpretation was made more valid by the leaked information and unofficial reports about the erection of an Israeli missile wall in southern Turkey that targeted Syria and Iran.

RESHAPING OF 7 PORTFOLIOS SURMISED IN EGYPT IN OCTOBER
Meanwhile, observers predict that a large-scale government reshuffle will take place next October, with the ministers of economy, electricity, public enterprise, education, administrative development and insurance being expected to be given the ax.
Amr Hammuda, who specializes in unveiling Israeli schemes for building bridges of cooperation with Arab States in the field of oil production, revealed that after the Oslo Conference, Israel launched a large project for expanding the Iranian pipeline to increase its capacity by 33% from 900,000 barrels of crude per day to 1,200,000 barrels per day.
As for the Egyptian-Israeli Transgas pipeline, which Israel proposed to Egypt in 1989 through a study made by Professor Chaim Ben Shahar, who proposed the collection of natural gas from North Delta fields in Egypt and pumping it into a pipeline that starts in Port Fouad then passes through North Sinai until it reaches Karim Shalom settlement, the study said that Israel received 250 million cubic feet of natural gas per day through that pipeline, which passed under areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority. The report indicated that there was much debate in Egyptian circles at present over the feasibility of selling Egyptian natural gas to Israel, as the Egyptian natural gas reserves currently stood at 21 trillion cubic feet only. Meanwhile, Egyptian Petroleum Minister Eng Sameh Fahmi denied the implementation of any deals for selling Egyptian natural gas to Israel at present.

Essam Al-Ahmadi belongs to the Banque Misr school.
The son became a board member, a deputy chairman and then a bank president.
He has been the president of Misr International Bank for three years.
He is a kin to the "Free Officers" movement. He occupied different posts in the political power corridors.
Ezzi took up the post of the president of the Principal Bank for Agricultural Development. Ezzi quit this post when he became 65 years of age.
He is 75 years old at present.
Two years later, they favored him and chose him president of Misr-Iran Bank, which the government put up for sale.
Abdullah Tayel, for instance, got the presidency of Bank Misr Exterior as a bribe.
One of those who were appointed bank president as a kind of honor was former minister of finance Mohamed Al-Razzaz, who played a great role in implementing the financial reform plan.
He was a chairman of a public sector company, a minister of economy and a partner to Al-Noran Company, specialized in sugar imports.
By so doing, Ahmed Dia Al-Din remained at the top of the National Bank of Egypt, Bahaa Helmi at the top of Banque Misr, Mohamed Abdel Sallam (Bank of Alexandria), Abdel-Hamid Bassal (the Industrial Bank), and Alaa Al-Ossiya (the Arab Land Bank).

Fouad Al Said, an Egyptian writer, wrote an article in Al-Hayat under this headline, saying:
However, the opening of the file has other implications in the eyes of another sector of Egyptian Copts, for Cairo is now witnessing the first harbingers of the emergence of a secular attitude within the cultured Coptic elite, which considers that the first step for proceeding with the Coptic file is to launch a necessary "reform of the Church." Dr Milad Hanna has called for the creation of a papal committee for religious reform, enlightenment and reorganization of the Church, which still operates under ancient clerical concepts and methods, describing the controls laid down by Pope Shinouda for regulating visits to monasteries as insufficient.
Anba Aminus, who is known for piety and austerity, has imposed charges on evening marriage ceremonies in order to reinstate the daytime marriage ceremonies, which, while free of charge, are an old Church rite.
There is also another development that should be scrutinized: a general national attitude has emerged that is shared by Muslims, Copts and secularists and is based on two points. The first point relates to the definition of the crisis of the defrocked priest as a problem that involves the "relationship between the Church and the State," to quote Islamic thinker Tarek Al Bishri.
Nasserite leader Amin Iskander, a Copt, points out that the Church has been raising up its congregation in a manner that isolates them from the issues of the Egyptian community, either by presenting Church history as an issue that is separate from the country's history and culture or collides with that history (see Al Arabi, 15 July 2001).
This turn in the Egyptian mentality's approach to the Coptic issue may be necessary to open the whole cultural file, for it is not true that Coptic culture is the only one that merits the adjectives "secondary" and "counter." We should not forget that there is another thing in Egypt that is worthy of description as a full "cultural project," by which I mean the "Islamic Project," which was previously proposed as an alternative cultural-political project that was capable of providing the requirements of a "project" to those social sectors that had adopted it, starting with the overview of life and ending with rules of thinking and social conduct.
Egypt's Mufti Dr. Nasr Farid Wasel has resolved the controversy in Egypt about the legitimacy of transplanting human organs from the living and the dead!

The latest terrorist attack should be the last act of terrorism. The United States should reconsider its policy as a whole, for it should not antagonize everybody, ally, friend and foe alike, and then insist that it is right and the rest of the world is wrong.
To elaborate a little, the United States must prove to Arab and Muslim countries that it is not the enemy. It must show that its support to Israel stops at certain limits that do not include aggression on the rights of the Palestinians and the sanctities of Muslims. If the United States does that, it will not convince everybody, for there will remain terrorists who still insist on carrying out their crimes, but at least it will give its allies and friends the ability to cooperate with it in a unified stand against terrorism.

"I am saying that because it is not easy for Washington to change the main course of its foreign policy as a result of several bombings, whatever the losses that may result from them.

SCENES FROM A FARCE
The experts and professors of international law that I have interviewed are surprised, even stunned, at this attitude. Dr Kamal Abul Magd, a United Nations judge, described it as an attitude of "dominating arrogance" that stems from an excessive feeling of power that leads to ignoring the simplest rules of justice and logic at the same time. There is no doubt that there is a widespread denunciation of the terrorist attack.
Added to this is that the list of suspected Arabs that the US Department of Justice comprises 19 people whom nobody knows whether they were the hijackers or just ordinary passengers who happened to be on the doomed aircraft.
The peculiar thing about this situation is that when the Arabs and Muslims denounce and deny the generalization of the accusation against them, they in fact behave as if they are suspects who have to prove their innocence and wash their hands of the charge. This was quite evident in the race by all those who counted to denounce what happened and insist on all the media that Islam is a religion of peace that rejects violence and prohibits attacks against innocent civilians, even in war, to the end of the list of denunciations. Everybody competed to deny something they did not do and were not party to, anything that no clear evidence has been found to indicate who did it.
When I read these messages, I immediately remembered the story of the Chinese American nuclear scientist, Wan Ho Li, who was accused a couple of years ago of leaking information on American nuclear research and spying for his mother country. The FBI arrested Li and charged him with 59 counts, 39 of which were punishable by life imprisonment. The man was scandalized, and the American media painted him in the image of a dangerous spy who had threatened America's national security. The picture of the manacled scientist was splashed all over television screens on every occasion.
WHY IS THAT POPULAR CONTENTMENT WITH ATTACKS ON AMERICAN CITIES?
However, much suffering on the part of those peoples has given predominance to feelings of contentment. Feelings have, therefore, been dominated by hatred of American policy, a hatred that got deep under Egypt and Arab skin.
It is as if the Palestinians and the Arabs, rather than the Europeans were the perpetrators. It is as if the permanent aggression on Palestine with guns, planes, tanks and bulldozers and the killing of one thousand innocent martyrs in less than a year, half of them were children, had nothing to do with human rights. Neither the Palestinian nor the Arab whether Muslim or Christian is considered human being in the eyes of the unfair West.
Iraq is almost the sole country in that world that has not condemned the suicidal attacks to which the US was exposed. Moreover, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein issued statements, considered by Washington "provocative and terrorist." Saddam said: "America is harvesting the thorns planted by its rulers in the world." For their part, Iraqi opposition forces condemned the attacks, though their statements included different criticisms to the US.
Responding to Saddam's provocative statements, US Secretary of State Colin Powell considered Saddam "a symbol of terrorism." Powell also said Saddam has no drop of human blood.
Although Allawi denounced "the terrorist operations," describing them as forming "an anti-Arab and anti-Muslim attitude in America and other different areas in the world, he lashed out at the American stance on Iraq. "The US Administration was not serious in its attitude towards the Iraqi regime, despite its terrorist record in suppressing the Iraqi people, its aggression on the Arabs and Muslims, its fighting of moderate Islamic forces, its support of the extremist forces, and its coordination with Bin Laden's organizations," Allawi said.
However, the Party's condemnation of terrorism did not make it forget to point out that "the terrorist action was the bitter fruit of the American policy itself inside and outside the US and of the adoption of capitalist methods." The Party expected that the US would remain a target of terrorism.

In a call with Al-Wasat in Cairo, Arab fundamentalists asserted that following the latest incidents in the US, Usama Bin Laden had left Afghanistan for an unknown place. He was accompanied by a number of his supporters, foremost among whom is Dr. Ayman Al-Zawahri, leader of the Egyptian Jihad Group, and Hafez Abu Setta, nicknamed as the Egyptian Abu Hafs, who is the military leader of the Base Organization, in addition to scores of Arab Afghans. Sources from outside Egypt said Bin Laden moved to a border area, pending an imminent American attack following plane suicide operations, although he denied any relation to these acts. Experts in the affairs of fundamentalist movements ruled out the possibility that any agency, which may be doubted of having links to Bin Laden, would claim responsibility for the operations.
The fatwa, which was promulgated by the Islamic Action Front Party in a press communiqué, said, "Alliance with the United States for launching aggression against any Muslim country is haram (illegal from the point of view of Sharia), and is an act of treachery against Allah, His Messenger and the community of believers.

LEGISLATIVE REVOLUTION TO PURGE EGYPTIAN LAWS OF COMMUNIST IDEAS
The independent members said all PA members, however different their political orientations might be, have equal legal status. Therefore, all PA members should practice parliamentary action on equal footing with one another regardless of the partisan inclinations. The independent members said the PA statute violated the principle of equality when it distinguished the PA members, who belong to political parties, from those who do not belong to any regarding parliamentary formations and delegations that represent the PA in foreign visits. The statute also violated this principle regarding the giving of the floor to the PA members, they said.
The independent members said actual political reform starts from giving a free rein to the formation of parties and issuance of newspapers because these two points are related to the freedom of expression, which is the base of democracy.

-	Rejection of the confusion of counterterrorism with the legitimate struggle of peoples against foreign occupation, which is guaranteed by the United Nations Charter. -	Confrontation of those who commit terrorist crimes, whatever they are, because terrorism is a world phenomenon that is rejected by religions and human values. -	The necessity of confronting terrorism within the context of international legitimacy organizations. -	Forging a unified Arab stand against this phenomenon, so as to establish international stability and global peace. -	Not linking terrorism to Islam and the Arabs, so as to avoid a rift between the world on the one hand and the Arab Muslims on the other hand and so that stands may not turn into a conflict of religions and civilizations.

Question: In the wake of the catastrophe that befell the US, it seemed that the West started to launch a war against Islam under the pretext of combating terrorism. Hence, it started a ferocious campaign, whose repercussions on the nation are feared. What do you think?
Question: If the West launches military crackdowns against Arab and Islamic countries, what should we do?
Question: In addition to the poisonous campaigns against us, we saw how the West sides with Israel. American politicians grant legitimacy to Israel's physical liquidation of Palestinians. They justify Israel's use of American weapons under the pretext that Israel does not violate the law because it defends its security. What do you think?
We should not pay heed to what the Israelis are saying that the Palestinians' acts are terrorism. This is wrong and can be refuted through what is taking place in actual reality. Moreover, whenever a Palestinian detonates himself onto Israeli military, he will be a martyr.
I say that those who try to kill me should be killed. I do not urge (Muslims) to kill innocent people or those who have nothing to do in this war.
"A 'crusade' is a hateful thing that was introduced into historical terminology by Franks, who were mistakenly called as 'crusaders,' but the Cross is completely innocent of them because it symbolized sacrifice, not aggression," the Pope said.
Moreover, there are Muslim countries that have good relations and agreements with the United States in some fields.
MUFTI: TERMS COULD DIVIDE THE WORLD, PREVENT ESTABLISHMENT OF ASPIRED PEACE
I personally believe that somebody might have insinuated the use of the word 'crusade' deliberately or inadvertently to serve a political purpose, but only Allah knows what happened.
They pointed out that the decline in the dollar rate of exchange before other currencies such as the euro, the yen and the pound sterling would make a havoc on the Egyptian trade balance with the region of those currencies including the European Union which monopolizes over 40% of Egyptian external trade because the imports bill would rise against a rise in export costs.
He pointed out that such exports amounted to about $215 million during the first half of this year, to quote the report of Commercial Representation Body.
Head of Exporters Department at Egyptian Federation of Chambers of Commerce, Hilal Sheta expects that military operations climates may extend to Europe thus threatening most Egyptian exports especially agricultural ones.
He added that the volume of trade exchange between Cairo and Washington amounts to about 27.7% of the total of Egypt's foreign trade and that Egypt's total exports to America in the first quarter of this year hit $217 million against $910 million in imports.
Tourism experts estimate expected losses at more than $1.2 billion in case of the outbreak of military operations while the time or geographical zone are entirely unknown to anybody.
It pointed out that the percentage of American contributions in such capital is more than 27%.
Although our Egyptian exports constitute only a small percentage of the volume of textiles and clothes trade in America, this country is considered to be a very important market for Egypt. The question, now, is: will the Egyptian exports be really affected by what happened in the USA?
No working plan or programme is now possible so far as a complete vision is entirely substantial.
TRAINED LABOUR, GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION INSTRUMENTAL FOR ATTRACTING FOREIGN INVESTMENTS TO EGYPT
By studying the Egyptian market, the Korean side found it had a number of opportunities and capabilities including qualified trained labour that can use the latest technologies required in industry. Investment in Egypt provides investment chances in the region countries whether African or Arab, he said.
CBE APPROVES REDUCTION OF MONETARY RESERVES
HSS/ Al-Ittihad, 22/9/2001
In an obvious allusion to Osama Bin Laden the front affirmed that the means required for executing the attacks that had happened could never have been available to one man, whatever his capabilities.
The communiqué pointed out that the terrorism and violence committed by Israel were no less hideous than the attacks in New York and Washington.
The scholars concluded their communiqué by saying, "While we denounce aggressions against innocent people everywhere, we do not condone aggression on the innocent people of the Muslim Nation, whatever the motives or circumstances. Terrorism is not combated by spreading it; it is countered by providing justice to the wronged and respecting the rights of people in their homes and their lands."
The crusade spirit explains the conflict between the Christian West and the Muslim Arabs, thus exceeding the real factors of class contradictions, economic exploitation, colonialism and others.
US President George W. Bush unconsciously mentioned the word "crusade", while speaking about the war which he threatened to declare in retaliation for the attacks on New York and Washington.
Can we interpret that the fierce economic war, waged by the Christian West against Muslim societies, is aimed at impoverishing them and making them lag behind for good?
Hanan Al Badri wrote the following news report in Rose Al Yousef:
As for the expectations of what may happen and the nature of the American reaction, they will not differ from the following, as American experts have admitted: -	Dispatching 4 aircraft carrier groups to the Mediterranean and Persian Gulf to reinforce the already massive US forces there.
-	Setting a timetable for the battle, which is expected to begin at the end of the second week of November this year.
-	Weakening the regional influence of Russia and Iran in that part of the world. This move will bring Iran under American siege from the east, in addition to the west, where Teheran is already blocked from the direction of the Persian Gulf, thus robbing the Iranians of any influence they may still have and relegating it a much lower standing on the American list of interests. Besides, it will turn the Gulf oil into something of little importance, so that the Persian Gulf area may become more dependent on the United States rather than tied to it by common interests.
-	Frustrating Russia's attempts for alliance with China and India.

Huwaidi: The significance is that it is under a semi-collapse for a small number of individuals could hit the global economy, represented in the World Trade Center, and the Pentagon.
On the other hand, the rash US Republican Administration failed to meet the public opinion's expectations and provide security for Americans.
Americans should ask themselves by day and at night these questions: why did this occur?
If they do not face a military action, there will be a blackmailing of the remaining Arab money. If not, why was the name of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) mentioned?
They should have a weighty presence in the US decision-making milieus so that Israel can not exploit the critical situation in which the US is locked at present.
No, never.
A Pakistani expert on Afghanistan warned against the possibility of an international crisis into which Iran and China would be dragged if the United States invaded Afghanistan. Meanwhile, a former senior Pakistani government official affirmed that the Americans would pounce on the Taliban within less than 12 months after occupying the cities that constituted the power base of the Afghan movement.
He added that Iran would finance the war against American forces because it would be concerned over the United States entry into its backyard, while China would fuel the war in a bid to keep the United States preoccupied and take its place on the eastern coast of the Persian Gulf.
The American plan provides for the occupation of the cities of Kundhar, Hirat, Kabul, Mazar Sharif, Jalalabad and other major cities."
31-A LARGE-SCALE ISRAELI AGGRESSION ON LEBANON SYNCHRONIZING WITH STRIKING AFGHANISTAN
34-Data received by Lebanon point out that Premier Sharon had prepared a dual plan to launch devastating attacks on the Lebanese and the Palestinians at the same time. Security surveillance sources in South Lebanon unveiled a large- scale operation to evacuate the settlements was started last week in case Hizbullah retaliates by using his Katyusha missiles. There is an Israeli military build up along the borders with Lebanon. The Israeli forces air and land provocative measures have been taken, in an attempt to drag Hizbullah into a comprehensive war.
The high number of such robberies has made the Turkish Cyprus population on the lookout, appointing security agents to observe the Israelis and take stock of hotel room contents and to watch the Israelis on their shopping tours.

Senior advisor to Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) governor, Mohamed Al-Barbari said the Egyptian new interest rate need not be reduced to follow the suit of major international central banks that reduced their currencies interest rates to back the dollar following the recent American events.
On his part, Mohamed Al-Abiad, head of the exchange department at the Federation of Chambers of Commerce told Al-Alam Al-Youm that the demand for the dollar at exchange companies had considerably retreated in the aftermath of the American events so much so that it was almost nil in the last four or five days He pointed out that the total of what exchange companies collect daily averages about $6 million which are wholly sold to banks.
Also on the rise was the volume of foreign assets and debits as well as credit facilities from banks other than the CBE. Domestic credit, however, retreated and inflationary rates rose on a monthly basis but maintained stability on an annual basis.
PROPOSALS OF EGYPTIAN INVESTORS AFTER AMERICAN EVENTS
Aboul-Enein suggested that investment banks contribute directly to various investment fields especially where we enjoy a relative advantage. National banks self-reliance should also be encouraged through using development and updating techniques and restructuring their financial resources.

EGYPTIAN EXPORTS TO EUROPE NOT AFFECTED BY US ATTACKS
Al-Wafd, 23/9/2001
Bank sources told Al-Hayat that the temporary suspension decision resulted from lack of seriousness of Arab bids several months ago it was announced that such bids would be subject to negotiations.
The bank board of directors thought the circumstances undergone by the international economy in the aftermath of the terrorist operations which the USA had suffered from may affect the price of oil and investment pumped into that sector, especially if Washington decided to resort to a shrinkage policy that would affect its consumption of oil and fuel. This would make it rather difficult to get a good bid for selling.
The new projects aim at developing production for exportation. This will be done in cooperation with the distinguished Indian expertise in these fields.

Such bodies include Al-Azhar Scholars Front whose conflict with the government was referred to the judiciary. This time, however, such bodies found in Mubarak's attitude something worth hailing.
Nevertheless, the parliament's foreign affairs committee deputy chairman, Dr. Mostafa al-Fiqi found no contradiction in Mubarak's attitudes towards the two events.
He saw the Egyptian stance as very balanced. Egypt is against terrorism and supports curtailing it, but it is against meting out punishment to an entire people just to take revenge on one individual.
Taliban officials said, "The USA has nipped in the bud the process which Afghan scholars tried to launch last Thursday when they recommended that Bin Laden leave voluntarily.
In reply to a question about the USA possible targeting of the life of the Movement leader, Mullah Mohamed Omar, Daif said, "If he was martyred, we would find a successor. Everyone of us is Mullah Omar."
In reply to a question regarding Pakistani Islamic groups volunteers possible joining of Taliban should Afghanistan be exposed to an attack, Daif did not rule out that possibility. He added, "The matter is subject to Pakistani scholars religious opinion."
Afghan opposition sources, said the helicopters had fallen because of a technical fault rather than any Taliban shelling. However, they denied any information about the fate of the espionage plane.
In a statement, they said that such an action "would be considered as a violation of the simplest principles of justice and neutrality that require the availability of definite evidence against the suspects."
They, nevertheless, said, "Any random punishment against peoples in the name of combatting terrorism is a violation of the simplest principle of justice."
The signatories called on the UN Secretary General as well as the leaders of Arab and Islamic world and the European countries to do their duty by slopping the wave of hatred against Islam and Muslims and sparing the world involvement once again in shedding innocent blood. Escalating violence would only lead to bigger conflicts and confrontations between the USA and the peoples of the world.

Such misgivings have been confined by Abdel-Muneim Khalifa, president of Al-Nasr Automotive who said, that domestic production is undergoing a recession adding that the government must ban imports for two years at least so that the idle stock might be sold in a bid to protect national factories from closure due to the heavy burdens weighing on such industry that still relies on assembling by a percentage that reaches 75%.
Meanwhile, owners of private airline companies complained that the touristic and flight operations of their companies had been affected badly and that they had had to cancel 80% of their flights since the recent incidents in the United States. Mousa Al Sherif, owner of ETAS Air Transport Company, said in an exclusive statement to Al Alam Al Youm Weekly that most of the charter flights of his company had been cancelled, pointing out that there was a price reduction war among airlines, which put Egyptian companies in a very awkward situation because they could make no further price reductions.

GREEK-CYPRIOT-ISRAELI ALLIANCE IS NOT A DANGER TO EGYPTIAN MARKET
The source explained that there was no fear whatsoever that the Egyptian stock market might be affected by that tripartite alliance, as the Greek government was keen on bolstering its cooperation with Cyprus, Turkey and Israel for attracting more investments to the region as a measure for facing up to European capital markets and breaking the state of isolation that had afflicted the Greek stock market in the wake of the 30% drop of its index in June last. "This drop was the worst one on the Greek stock market, despite its official joining of the Morgan Stanley Index of Advanced Countries (MSCI) at the same time," he concluded.
The bankers pointed out that the influx of cash would enable banks to conclude settlements with delinquent customers, rescheduling their debts as per the agreement with the government.
In addition, banks have managed to collect some LE2 billion since March this year, this means that the monetary authorities have put their finger on the appropriate solution for the problem of recession that the Egyptian market has been suffering for some time," he said.
This announcement was made by the French Minister of Transportation, Housing and Installations during him meeting with the Minister of Transportation, Dr Ebrahim Al Demairi.
MFA, Al Ahram, 24/9/2001 AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL CENTRE TO BE ESTABLISHED IN LUXOR WITH FRENCH HELP
Anxiety at both the official and public Kuwaiti levels stems from the results that may ensue after the Emir's illness and disappearance from the political scene, God forbid. The succession problem is one of the complicated problems facing Kuwait and all the efforts made to solve it ended up in smoke.
63-A member of the Kuwaiti Nation's Council who requested anonymity told Al- Quds AL-Arabi that the ruling family in Kuwait had only two options regarding the succession issue. The first option is the following of the Saudi model by maintaining the status quo so that Sheikh Subah Al-Ahmed may run the state affairs from his backseat just as he is doing now and the first man (the Emir) and the second man (the crown prince) may be a mere façade. It is anomalous that the cerebral hemorrhage, which hit the Kuwaiti Emir, was the same disease that hit King Fahd of Saudi Arabia.
The expert says the branches of Al- Mubarak and Al-Khalid in the ruling family started to get strong and demand their share of power. Some people talk about the prominence of Sheikh Mohammed Al- Khalid, incumbent interior minister, who stands for educated young men in the family, expecting that he will strongly vie for an advanced position in power.
Therefore, it is difficult to predict which step will be taken by the ruling family in Kuwait regarding the succession issue and how it will be settled because the matter primarily depends on the health developments of Sheikh Jaber and the military and security developments in the Gulf during the coming few days as well as whether Iraq will be targeted by a new American aggression or not.

Although the documents would not change the course of the trial or mitigate the death penalty against McVeigh, US Attorney General Ashcroft stayed the execution, boasting when he announced his decision, "We have done that to protect the integrity of our judicial system, because hiding documents damages his right to a fair trial."
He is just a prime suspect in the barbaric attack on New York and Washington, and he has denied any connection with the attacks.
Were the terrorist actions of Timothy McVeigh who blew up the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma attributed to Christianity and Christians, or was he regarded as a member of a rogue group that had crossed the lines?
But when it comes to Osama Bin Laden's group, the Arabs and Muslims are guilty before we see a single shred of valuable evidence!
The United States is now standing at a difficult crossroads, and invisible hands may push it towards a collision with the Muslim World.
25-Major General (retired) Salah Eddin Selim, consultant to the Middle East Studies Institute, worte: 26-The Americans lied to the Gulf Arabs when they said that their military presence in the Arabian Gulf would be depleted once Kuwait was liberated.
The Americans refuse to start with a counterterrorism treaty; they only think of using NATO and Muslim and Arab countries to help Bush in his dirty war for destroying Afghanistan, after which he will launch the next phase of Operation Evil Eagle for breaking the bones of Hizbullah in Lebanon, the Islamic Group and Islamic Jihad in Egypt and Hamas and Islamic Jihad in Palestine, with no regard to the possible consequences on the national security of these Arab countries.
29-The situation is really dire, politically, economically and militarily, which calls for a national dialogue at all levels, covert and public, with a view to rationalizing the Egyptian political decision on managing the war against terrorism and political and economic reform in Egypt and the Arab Nation, which regards Egypt as the balancing force of the whole Arab World. We hope that the public opinion will face up to this hardship and show courage in expressing its views for the sake of first, Egypt, and second, our present and next generations.

The report pays no attention to the declared objective of the Islamic Group, whose membership does not exceed a few hundred people.
As for funding, the Islamic Group is financed by Iran and Osama Bin Laden, according to the report.
The question that remains unanswered is: Will the United States be interested in striking the hideout of terrorists in Egypt, assuming that they will remain holing up there, or it will leave this task to the Egyptian government, which has already been dealing with it?
While Washington may have to seek the permission of countries where the forces will be deployed, such as Pakistan, which will have to agree under pressure, the United States will not have such need in the case of target country, whose territories will be hit under the pretext of presence of terrorists.
48-Syrian Businessman, Mamoun Derkezli said that the American authorities had made a mistake regarding his name when he was included on the list of those whose assets in the USA would be frozen just as it had made mistakes regarding people who it suspected of involvement in hijacking planes, only to find out later that some of them was dead or was not present in the USA on the day of accident that took place a couple of weeks ago, according to what he said to Asharq Al-Awsat on the telephone from London yesterday.

On the other hand, an official with EgyptAir said in a report to Reuters the Egyptian government had initially offered $5 billion to airlines registered in Egypt in the form of insurance guarantees against war hazards in order to avoid the suspension of their airliners from work.
This development, Hassanein added, comes as a reaction to the hard-line attitude of re- insurance companies concerning the conditions of terrorism insurance document and the maximal limits of re-insurance in the wake of the recent American incidents.

Rather we will urge various countries to besiege and unveil terrorism, an effort that needs no evidence.

41-Q: Will the incidents in the United States have some positive effects in terms of alleviating the tension in the Middle East and pushing the Middle East peace process ahead in the forseeable future?
44-A: The picture of the military action and its scope is not complete yet. Up to our knowledge, no Arab country has been asked to join the coalition. We hope that no Arab country will be targeted, because no Arab country was involved in what happened as far as we know. The involvement of some Arabs does not mean that the Arab countries must be blamed for that, particularly as we have to take into account that many of the leaderships and groups that practice terrorism do not reside in Arab countries but in Europe. Their numbers in European countries are even more than those in Arab States at present!
For another, there is using the elements they host as a leverage against third-world countries, particularly in the Middle East. These European countries were not interested in the stability of the Middle East in the past.

This, consequently, led to its decline in Egypt by an average that reached one piaster per dollar, and 1.5 piasters in some banks. During the last days, however, the dollar has risen reaching its level before the American events.
Misr-Romania Bank general director, Abdel-Rahman Baraka said that the CBE raised the dollar selling rate of exchange to banks by one piaster to reach 426 piasters because banks used to get a big margin by buying the dollar from the CBE at 425 piastres. He added that such a new rate of exchange for selling the dollar by the CBE to banks means that the rate on the market circulates at its natural rate. Baraka points out that the dollar rate in Egypt is quite different from international rates. The dollar value in Egypt is determined according to supply and demand only.
This step has been taken by Egyptian banks within the framework of an international action in pursuit of the funds of groups suspected of involvement in violent acts in the recent events.
Abdel-Aziz added that the Egyptian banks realized the danger of such funds years ago and took measures that drained them altogether.

If protecting these interests requires a dialogue with the United States, then such dialogue should be initiated."

What happened in the textiles exports will extend to other exports, especially the Egyptian imports, which will lead to a new price rise wave for all commodities that are not subsidized by the government, especially food products.
It is worth mentioning that the customs duties is calculated according to the receipts of every product after adding the cost of freight, insurance etc, which means that the customs collected on exported goods will increase leading to a rise in its costs and prices.

81-Friday prayers were performed at Egyptian mosques amid strict security measures on October 12. However, demonstrations were staged following the prayers, particularly at Al-Azhar Mosque, where Grand Sheikh of Al-Azhar Mohamed Sayyed Tantawi criticized the anti-Islam campaign in his speech.
The superpower did not respect international legitimacy, while asking us to believe it."
Meanwhile, Palestinians staged anti-US protests at West Bank areas, particularly Nablus, where there were about 2000 protesters and Ramallah, where there were around 1500 demonstrators.
It was not long before official American reports and signals came out to indicate that dealing with the Palestinian rejection groups and Hizbullah will be the next mission of the American forces, but it will need more time and other technological and technical preparations.
As the demand for the arrest of such members would definitely be turned down, this could bring matters to a boil, as Washington may start thinking of getting rid of the Palestinian elements, particularly those stationed in Damascus and the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon, because of the American confusion that has produced unified lists of fundamentalist terrorist organizations and resistance groups as part of the lists compiled by the US State Department, which contain more than 61 Arab organizations and groups. These lists contain the names of all those who carried arms against Israel from the 1960's to date, except for one group, which is Yasser Arafat's Fatah Organization, and only because its name was taken off the US State Department lists in the wake of the signing of Oslo Agreement in 1993 between the Palestinian Authority and the Rabin Government. However, the Sharon government is making serious efforts for making the current US Administration return Fatah's name to the terrorism lists, on the pretext that it is Fatah that led the activities of the second Intifada, and therefore it, and all other Palestinian factions, for that matter, should be liquidated as terrorism movements.
Under worst-case scenario, should any American operations in the Arab World be postponed at present because of apprehension of angry reactions in the wake of the campaign on Afghanistan, the United States will settle for nothing less than dealing with Syria and Lebanon and will not allow immediate neighbourhood or interfere actively for solving the Middle East issue before liquidating resistance movements and organizations to please Israel. Therefore, it will apply more pressures on the concerned Arab States for more concessions under the guise of counterterrorism.

WHAT WILL YOU DO IF AMERICA HITS ARAB COUNTRIES?72-
74-	Military and strategic expert, Major General Talaat Musalam says: 	There is actually a collective defence agreement between Egypt and Syria in particular, and another one combining all Arab countries and forcing them to defend any Arab country when faced with external aggression. It seems to me that those countries are trying to evade such embarrassment when it has to stand up against America under such agreements. This is reflected by the statement of most Arab rulers headed by President Mubarak where they emphasized their rejection of any American aggression on Arab countries and their rejection of considering Hizbullah and Palestinian resistance groups as terrorist organizations.
Arab collective Defence Agreements consequently, will remain dead due to the weakness and division of Arab regimes. What about the reaction of various political trends?
"Muslim Brotherhood," he went on, "has announced its rejection of the American aggression on the Afghan people, which was published by most mass media. The General Guide will, furthermore, prepare a message to the American President George Bush voicing the Egyptian people's rejection of any potential American aggression on any Arab country."
Some Arab countries might go asunder. The margin of democracy in Egypt may well vanish altogether.
Islamic forces mostly prefer to voice their views by issuing statements to head off any violent reaction.
The movement said the operations "would not eradicate terrorism in the world and could not guarantee security for America and its allies. Rather, they would deepen sentiments of hatred and grudge against them and increase feelings of retaliation in the coming generations."

Afourki also explained that his country had taken stringent measures to protect itself that had reached the degree of severing diplomatic relations with Khartoum.
It is well known that Khartoum continues to shelter the Eritrean fundamentalist Jihad Organization, which has launched attacks on the western countryside of Ethiopia out of bases on Sudanese territories," he said.
Ethiopian analysts believe that Addis Ababa is quietly getting ready for the possibility of being the decisive American tool for hitting the Somali Islamic Union Organization, which is regarded as the strongest armed fundamentalist group. The Somali Islamic Union is believed to have played a pivotal role in uprooting the American presence in Somalia during the Clinton era.
48-SUDAN: ISLAMISTS WARN GOVERNMENT AGAINST BECOMING CIA "INFORMANT"
After the Sudanese government had admitted - through statements of its Foreign Minister, Dr Mostafa Osman Ismail and its Ambassador to the United States, Al Khidr Haroon Ahmad - that a team comprising agents of the CIA, the FBI agents and the US State Department's Counterterrorism Section had been in Khartoum for over 15 months, it was unable to set a date for the completion of the mission of the American team, whose members were allowed to visit all parts of the country and search all the locations that were suspected of having been used for training members of extremist fundamentalist organizations.
Sources close to the Sudanese ruling regime feel that the issue of cooperation with the United States, particularly in security-related matters, have begun to cause cracks in the coalition that emerged in the executive system in the wake of the marginalization of the role of Dr Hassan Al Turabi, which was followed by his estrangement and arrest, as the hard-liners believe that continuing to cooperate with America will eventually lead to demands for the heads of some prominent members of the ruling regime itself.
Similarly, there must be a third group that believes that trading secret files and sensitive information is an infallible way for eliminating both sides.
Meanwhile, the opponents of Sudanese-American security cooperation in pro- government circles wonder whether such concessions are enough to make Washington reward the Khartoum regime by protecting and supporting it and giving it a new lease on life despite national reconciliation, which would require the creation of a government with an expanded base for a transitional period, after which elections should be held to choose a selected government.

Thus, it is impermissible to commit aggression against anybody regardless of their religion, race or colour as Islam considers the killing of even one innocent man tantamount to mass murder of the whole mankind."
"If a non-Muslim entered a Muslim country legally, his safety should be ensured," he noted.

No hot water should be poured on the floor or used for bathing after night falls either.

THE LE200-BILLION DEFICIT SCOURGE!
Such a terrible imbalance between resources and expenditure in the public budget may be ascribed to basic structural factors that may be traced back to fiascos in financial and economic policies adopted since the 1970's.

93% OF YOUTH HAVE NO ELECTORAL CARDS
Hamas leader in Palestinian territories Mahmoud Al-Zahar announced the movement's readiness to reach a common ground with other Palestinian factions and the Palestinian Authority on the bases of "phased-in steps" provided that the determination of strategic goals be left to the Palestinian people through ballot boxes in free and fair elections.
Israeli withdrawal from Gaza Strip will take the Palestinian cause out of negotiations frame because it is a land that was freed through resistance, he said, calling for the repetition of a such model, which proves the validity of Hamas political vision.
The sources said that the Arab intelligence department submitted the file only three days after it had been officially asked to do so by Mossad Chief Meir Dagan. They pointed out that the file contained detailed information on Hamas presence in Tehran, Damascus, Beirut, Khartoum and Sanaa as well as some Gulf states and Hamas leaderships abroad.
In London, Arab sources pointed out that the Arab intelligence department file mainly dealt with Hamas leaderships abroad. The file information on Meshaal and his deputy, Mousa Abu Marzouk as well as political bureau members, Imad Al- Alami and Mohammed Nezal concentrated on the security aspects related to their movements, residence, habits and personal traits and behaviour as well as on data about their food, drink, and laundry and the character and role of each of them.
The Mossad asked an Arab intelligence department to collect information about the movement leaders abroad, a case which was ascribed by the sources to the shortage of information about Hamas structure abroad and the inability to penetrate the organizational structure due to Hamas strictness in selection of cadres and limited recruitment of new elements.
Through yesterday's blast, Ariel Sharon's government has thus started the second stage in the liquidation of Hamas leaders, activists and symbols, this time outside Palestine.
Sharon's short-term plans, of course, include expelling Hamas from Damascus and Beirut and even Beqaa without having to repeat the Turkish scenario that extracted Kurdistani Labour Party leader, Abdulla Ocalan from the Syrian umbrella so long as luck smiled upon Sharon through the American enormous campaign to cut to size the Syrian role in the region and force it to withdraw into its own worth.
Between pulling the teeth and cutting the wings there lies a lot of whispering about the roles of "wings" in this region unprecedentedly beleaguered by American-Israeli pressure which are carefully scheduled by President George W. Bush and his partner in what is called the war on terrorism, starting with Palestine through Iraq down to Lebanon where Hizbullah is placed on the list.
What is even more serious than expelling Hamas forcibly from Syria etc, is that the blasts synchronize with the Pentagon launch of a campaign on the Syrian Baath Party accusing it of providing support and funds to terrorism in Iraq as if the next goal of the Baath Administration, i.e. what the Americans' calls to the dismantlement of Al-Baath were urgent and impervious to any procrastination or speculation.
The reduction of ideological divergent views also covered opinions on negotiations with Israel as the military wing, which is supposed to obey the directives of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) leadership, now lashes out at the principle of negotiations between the PNA and Israel, condemns them as illegal, suspects their motives and even brands such communications as "disloyalty".
Thence, it was not difficult to enlist "martyrs".
This pushed the occupation army to set up invincible fortifications around Jewish settlements and military positions. Seeking to invent means of overcoming such fortifications, Palestinian resistance groups made improvised missiles, which, though not very effective, helped marginalize the role of fortifications in protecting Israeli soldiers and Jewish settlers.
This pushed Israel to attack hundreds of lathing and smithery workshops under the pretext that they played a role in making such rockets.
FORMER PALESTINIAN PREMIER ABU MAZEN: I DO NOT ACKNOWLEDGE RESISTANCE OPTION
Q-Has the Palestinian issue entered a dark tunnel and there is no hope for a solution whether at the Palestinian, Israeli, or international level?
In return, the other party, which is Palestinian, is required to close up national ranks. The authority should prepare itself to control its agencies and start a reform process that includes financial, administrative, and economic issues. Security seems to be the first thing that should undergo a reform. Then, an inter-Palestinian dialogue could be opened that would lead to a unified Palestinian opinion. The other expected steps like the elections and others should come after that. All this would make it possible to sit at the negotiating table with the Israeli side under quartet sponsorship for applying the roadmap.
A-I do not know. Q-You were one of the decision-makers, so shall I conclude that there was no determination when you took over as prime minister in the past period?
We took steps in order for the American government to pressure Israel to take similar steps. But, the US did not do this and did not hurry to pressure Israel. The Palestinian side started a frustration process towards the government. Let me say that this constituted an obstacle to the government performance, which gave me no choice but to leave the government through rendering my resignation.
Was it the authority with all its components though you were the head of a government that came from this authority?
Sharon's government does not want peace.
A-Resistance has nothing to do with reform.
Q-As regards the Israeli plan for unilateral withdrawal from Gaza and the application of the unilateral disengagement plan, do you think that there are real objections on the Israeli side?
This plan includes the following points. The first point is the withdrawal from Gaza. The second point is the attachment of settlement blocks in the West Bank to Israel. The third point is the prevention of refugees from returning.
A-I do not think so. Historically speaking, Israel has always said that Gaza is an evil land that it should leave. If they wanted to continue, they would continue. We do not want to exaggerate the matters and say that this is due to the resistance and wait to get more than this.
A-I rule out the option of military resistance in anything. We entered the Palestinian territories in 1994 for peace and in the name of peace. We should continue with this option because we have no other option but that of peace.
A: We are in a new stage requiring the unification of security bodies into 3 main bodies, firstly, internal security by which we mean the Ministry of the Interior and its affiliated bodies, secondly, the National Security and thirdly, Public Intelligence.
A: Each organization we have has its own philosophy in the conflict with Israel. The Islamic factions (Hamas and Jihad) have their own vision based on the continuation of struggle till all historic Palestine is restored, while other factions accept a Palestinian state on any liberated part, by which they mean the land occupied in 1967. Now there is a conflict between us and the Israelis about these concepts, they hit us so hard to deter the Palestinian party that retaliates with martyrdom operations. This means that there is a conflict between two wills neither of which has surrendered so far. The Intifada may flare up if the other party relaxed for a while, as offensives are then expected.
A: Egyptian brothers have played an important role in that sphere through Maj. Gen. Omar Soliman who paid more than one visit to the Palestinian President Yassir Arafat who is besieged in his headquarters in Ramallah. The team assisting Minister Soliman visited Gaza because they are very active in the operation of following up the Palestinian security file. They made great efforts in light of the forthcoming Israeli withdrawal from Gaza Strip so that the coming period may be devoted to preparing the scene due to the American role absence due to preoccupation with the presidential elections at the end of this year. In light also of the absence and exclusion of the European role, Egyptian brothers thought it apt to exploit the 3-4 month period to make some achievement in the form of preparations of the scene for the post-American elections period and the preparations for the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza by holding negotiations very shortly between various Palestinian factions besides constantly communicating over the programme of a comprehensive national action. We think that the most appropriate programme in that regard is the PLO programme which combines all factions apart from Islamic ones (Hamas and Jihad) and of course there will be some way out of the problem of their joining us.
A: Until an agreement is reached between the factions, there should be training steps on the Palestinian part. This training would be undertaken by Egypt due to its capabilities and experience in that field especially the Palestinians are unanimous about the Egyptian role. During the recent visit paid by Minister Omar Soliman to President Arafat, it was agreed on a training plan. Soliman presented a definite mechanism starting with a high level Palestinian delegation discussing with officials in Egypt the type of training and how to sustain it as well as the continuance of Egyptian-Palestinian security understanding in the service of Palestinian interests.
A: We are committed to maintaining security but according to the Palestinian reality. This means that we will not harass resistance men, as what I mean by security is criminal security including theft, murder, drug-trafficking, etc.

Al-Arabi learnt that the World Bank had continued its pressures on the Egyptian government to respond to its demands in order that it might extend $1-billion loan to Egypt. Such demands include the privatization of public Egyptian banks, reduction of direct or indirect subsidy allocations, reduction of the subsidy granted to economic authorities like the railways, public transport and sanitary drainage.

3-Q: Are the war goals confined to Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda organization, or will the war extend to other areas? Why was Bin Laden accused on the heels of the incidents without evidence?
In this context, I'd like to emphasize that the plan of the American intervention was drawn up last July but was only waiting the opportune moment for execution, which came in the form of the explosion. Bin Laden was accused in light of some of his former terrorist operations without finding any convincing evidence that prove Bin Laden's direct involvement in such high-technology bombings, which only can be perpetrated through the involvement of an effective intelligence service.
A: Because the USA failed to achieve the required balance between political and military planning and counted on the multinational coalition including some Arab and Islamic forces. It rushed into intervening in Afghanistan before it achieved coherence with various Pakistani forces, including the Pushtu, the majority to which Taliban belongs. America too is faced with Pakistan's rejection of a pure North opposition government in Kabul to avoid instability not only in Afghanistan but in Pakistan as well.
Never believe that there is an isolation tendency in America as without American overseas interests, the American welfare would be dealt a deadly hit. For instance, there are $800 billion Arab deposits in America for which the good heatred Arabs and Muslims receive an interest rate that is almost half the international interest rate. American gains of such inflow of investments amount to over $16 billion i.e. about $3 billion more than total economic military foreign aid extended by America to a considerable number of world countries.

17-Magdi Ahmad Hussein, member of the Labour Party and chief editor of the suspended Al Shaab newspaper, wrote in Al Ahrar:
Such a situation should in its turn build solid relations between the two sides that will reach beyond their ideological differences, curbing and cutting them to their true size.
Their routing and ousting from power in 1996 by the Taliban was the result of the hideous crimes they had committed against the Afghan people, and the shrinkage of their areas of control to only 5-10% of Afghan territories - prior to the American aggression - is but another proof of their political and popular failure.
If Iran is to continue to play its role as one of the pivotal powers, if not the most important power, of the Muslim World, it must wise up to the risks of this tightening American siege around it.
The first time was during the Second Gulf War, and the second is the war against Afghanistan.
If America is routed in Afghanistan, this will mean that it will fail to accomplish the objectives for which it came to the region.

This country is a republic, and, as such, its people are supposed to choose their president and vice-president."
Dr Mohammad Al Sayed Al Said, Deputy Director of Al Ahram Centre for Political and Strategic Studies, said, "I cannot think of any candidate for this position right now, because of the state of clinical death and stagnation that has afflicted political and partisan life in Egypt, resulting in the absence of young personalities from the political scene. However, I believe that most of the candidates on the twenty-man list are military officers who are efficient and have distinguished track records, although I do not have someone specific in mind. I believe that even if the whole country cast about in their minds, nobody will come up with the right man for this job."
Dr Refaat Al Said, Secretary General of the Grouping Progressive Party, said, "The president and vice-president should be selected through free elections from among more than one candidate.
As for the establishment from which the new vice-president will come, my personal view is that it is the person himself that matters and that it does not matter whether he is from the Armed Forces or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It also matters that he have good knowledge about public affairs, political sciences and economy, as well as enough experience. He shouldn't be a vice-president in name only but should be tasked with actual management of several affairs, as was the case with Sadat and Mubarak."

Halabi stressed that America knows the lesson of the Afghan swamp and that even in limited deployment of ground forces they will rely on the British forces which are good at ground and desert war and have high capacities of manoeuverability, penetration, and circling with breakthrough into the depth to take control of important positions.
Halabi said he believes that Afghanistan will not turn into mini-states each having a special relationship with a bigger power (America and the neighbouring states).

The Administrative Affairs Court stated that the Social Justice Party had not received annual aid from the Shura Council for FY 1998/99 and that the responsible administrative quarters had justified their refraining from providing such aid by the existence of an dispute over the party's chairmanship that had heretofore not been solved in or out of court and that there was no legal text requiring them to provide aid to certain parties in a specific manner. It added that the Social Justice Party was an existent Egyptian political party that had not been abolished or merged into another party and that, like other parties, it was required to contribute to political life and economic and social affairs in the country by sharing in the responsibilities of government. Therefore, the principle of equality and equal opportunity among all who had equal legal positions and had identical conditions required that the Social Justice Party be supported by the Shura Council, on equal footing with the other parties that had received financial support in FY 1998/99, the Court decided.
The Egyptian authorities arrested more than 15 Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan) Group leading figures, foremost among whom is the Secretary-General of the Group's Guidance Office, Dr Mahmoud Ghazlan. The authorities referred them to the State Security Prosecution which conducted investigations with them upon charges of "joining a clandestine organization aiming at opposing the existing ruling regime in the country, being in possession of publications that incite hatred of the regime and exploiting the incidents at world level for inciting masses against the government.
The Egyptian law bans remanding in custody of defendants by the Prosecution in cases under investigation more than six months.
In a statement, the Brotherhood condemned and expressed surprise at the arrests of its members in light of the grave incidents the world witnesses. The Group considered what happened "serving none but contributing to the unjust practices."
Egyptian security sources said that an Egyptian police officer had been hit by an Israeli bullet on the Egyptian-Israeli border while Israeli forces were invading the Palestinian Rafah town on the morning of 5 November.

Under the headline, "Why did the Egyptian Students Demonstrate?", Sidhoum emphasized that the demonstrators had fallen victim to a fault or rather defect in the political and mass media discourse which dominate our country. That discourse always focuses on a Palestinian victim and an Israeli victor.
Gamal Asaad Abdel-Malak says, "The article written by Watani chief editor Youssef Sedhoum, undoubtedly has shocked all Egyptians because many people think that Watani newspaper is the organ of the Church and Christianity and that all that is written in it expresses the Coptic view point.
If there is a body that expresses the spiritual and religious rather than the political attitude of the Copts, it is definitely the Synod that is authorized to give statements voicing the Church's spiritual rather than political attitude because the latter is a personal right of the Copt as an Egyptian citizen.
Dr. Gamil Gorgi who is economic advisor to Cairo governor says: Firstly, we should take it for granted that Sidhoum's argument is only a personal point of view. The fact that he is a Christian or that what he wrote came in a newspaper where Christian symbols also write does not mean that his argument expresses the Church's attitude. Secondly, the Church's attitude towards the Palestinian cause is quite obvious and well known to everybody.
Ishaq urged Watani's chief editor to reconsider his views and write an article that would remove the ambiguity caused by his former article. He added that many Copts disagree with the newspaper's policies. The fact that the Pope writes a weekly article in Watani does not mean that it is the mouthpiece of the Church.
ISRAELI OFFICER KILLED IN FIRST JOINT ATTACK BY FATEH AND HAMAS ON ISRAELI BASE
NEW PFLP SECRETARY GENERAL: PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY'S PROBLEM IS ILLUSION
Since 1993, Sa'adat's name was on Israel's lists of wanted people, and when his reign in the PFLP's Secretariat General was inaugurated with the assassination of Israeli Tourism Minister Rehavam Zeevi by PFLP members, Sa'adat became number one on the list. Al Wassat interviewed the PFLP Secretary General.
We have been living in illusions for over ten years. What have we gained from the Madrid and Oslo negotiations?
Q: What is your comment on the Palestinian Authority's apprehension of PFLP members? A: We are not concerned over the arrests themselves as much as we are concerned by their politica32*1l implications.
Q: How do you describe your relations with the Palestinian Authority at present, and what is your stand on the cease-fire and resumption of negotiations?
That is why we believe that the Intifada and resistance are the best tools for driving the occupiers out and achieving the objectives that were, and are, difficult to accomplish through any negotiations under the Oslo Agreement. However, we do not rule out negotiations as a shortcut to the achievement of our people's goals, which we see as still being far and requiring drastic changes in the balance of powers between our people and the occupiers.
Q: How do you describe your relations with Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad?
In other words, we fully agree with Hamas and Jihad on the political view of how to conduct our national struggle, but we disagree with them on other issues, as views and ideologies must differ on certain issues.
MFA, Al Wassat, 5/11/2001
The Arab League chief ruled out the eradication of terrorism unless the Israeli destruction and devastation policy against the Palestinian people are stopped.

He warned that the plan would "pose a threat to the safe area" set up by the US and Britain post-Gulf War II. "George W. Bush Administration told us that it was carefully monitoring the Iraqi moves and saw that Saddam (Iraq's president) might take the advantage of the current international circumstances. The administration also said it was committed to the red lines, which it warned Saddam against overstepping or he would pay dearly."
He made it certain that the Iraqi authorities "have recently sent equipment to the southern bank of Tigris."

12-MFA, Al Hayat, 8/11/2001
This is the first time the Turkish officials talk so explicitly about the annexation of Northern Cyprus to Turkey after they had contended themselves with implicit remarks during their talks with the European Union over the prospects of Cyprus.
Turkish officials statements came within the framework of a clear message of warning to the European Union which tends to announce its approval of the Cypriot republic joining it next year, without waiting until the Cypriot problem is solved, an attitude that Ankara considers inciting Greek Cypriots to become intransigent and to insist on the unification of the island under a federal system. Ankara, on the other hand, insists on an international recognition of the Northern Cyprus Republic and just then entering negotiations to announce a Cypriot confederation between the island's two parts, the Turkish and the Greek parts.
17-A new step has been taken by the USA and Britain in their declared war against terrorism through their inclusion of eight Arab organizations, seven of which are fighting Israel, in the list of organizations whose assets have been frozen.
The declaration triggered indignant reactions by the concerned organizations contacted by Al-Hayat, Deputy Ammar Al-Mousawi of Hezbollah told Al-Hayat that the list as well as the Israeli praise of it is ridiculous. He added that the list was worthless in light of the Arab attitude that calls for discriminating between terrorism and liberation.
He went on to say that the Popular Front was a basic part of the PLO, which is recognized at both Arab and international levels, an Arab League member and a UN observer member.
He pointed out that he was not sure whether such measures would restrict the action of the organization supporters in the Arab world in the future.
He denied any such accounts or assets being held by Hamas, which makes such talk quite valueless.
The statement voiced surprise at the continuation of military trials of civilians and professors for the "terrible" charge of saying "there is only one God" and their attempt, "to raise the banner of Islam", the statement added; "The Jews are killing our brethren in Palestine and American crusaders are exterminating a Muslim people in Afghanistan, while you are doing nothing here!

He also opined that it was easy for Usama Bin Laden to gain entry into Somalia because it had 27 illegal ports.
"I believe that the leaders of the Somalese National Reconciliation Council can get rid of terrorist groups by cooperating with the affected countries and the United States, which considers combating these groups as one of its priorities," he said, affirming that he would not accept any military strikes against Somalia and that he was against the "random air strikes that kill innocent civilians," meaning those against Afghanistan.
29-President Hosni Mubarak announced during the inauguration of Al Firdan Railway Bridge on the Suez Canal that the bridge was the best reply to the allegations of those who threw doubts on Egypt's attitude towards peace. He said, "This is the biggest and most important evidence that Egypt is serious in following the path of peace. Could we have built this bridge, which cost LE 400 million, and the railroad only to have them bombed?
He called on the power that blindly supported Israel to consider the seriousness of the situation, adding that Israel continued to acquire weapons and that America continued to supply it with weapons.
32-Addressing the UN General Assembly on November 14th, Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher in Egypt's statement, delivered by Egypt's delegate to the UN Ambassador Ahmed Abul-Gheit, said that a political settlement of the Palestinian cause required that Israel stop considering its occupation of Arab lands as a means of achieving security. It should also perceive that its position in the Middle East would not actually improve unless it politically decided to abide by the pre-5th June 1967 borders, in addition to the establishment of a Palestinian State and returning east Jerusalem to the Palestinian sovereignty.

37-GAMAL MUBARAK: AMENDING THE ELECTIOINS LAW BEFORE 2005
39-HZM, Al-Ahrar, 15/11/2001
Mubarak called upon deputies to necessarily put that political mission into effect during the current parliamentary session and reach a political consensus.
44-The Court of Cassation has declared as null and void the elections of Rami Lakah, (Al-Daher and Azbakeya constituency - professionals) for dual nationality, Amal Othaman Abdel-Rehim (professionals) and Sayyed Moustafa Ismail Gowhar (workers) for Dokki constituency for some committees lacking the signatures of the committee head and the appointed secretary: Fawzi Al-Sayyed Ahmed, Sayyed Abdel-Ghani Ahmed (Nasr City constituency), Hazim Zaki Amin (professionals), Ahmed Mohamed Mitwalli Darwish (workers) for Sohag constituency because they proved to be the ones with the smallest number of votes; Fawzi Mohamed Hamdi (workers) and Ahmed Azmi Abdel-Wahab Al-Qot (professionals) for Kom Hamada constituency - Beheira for including some dead people as well as repeated and illusory names in the voting lists; Mohamed Naguib Khalid (professionals) for Al-Gamaleya constituency, Dakahlia governorate for getting a smaller number of votes than the other contestant; Abdel-Ghaffar Mohamed Al- Gazzar for Beyala, Kafr Al-Sheikh governorate for failure to sort out the box of committee 51.45-M.S.
Addressing a ceremony that the party held at its headquarters to celebrate the 83rd anniversary of the national struggle, Al Wafd Party Chairman called for selecting the Egyptian President by voters through direct elections in which other candidates would run. He also suggested that the candidate whose party won the elections should step down from the chairmanship of his party, so as to give all parties an equal opportunity for sharing power.
50-Under this heading, Hassanain Kuroum writes to say: Gamal Mubarak has chosen to go into politics through membership in the ruling National Democratic Party's Secretariat General, where he now leads the renewal trend and is trying to attract the younger generation to it, as demonstrated by his activities before the People's Assembly elections in November 2000, including tours of several governorates and nomination of several new faces to pump fresh blood into the party's representation base. He has also begun a new movement several days ago for installing a modern communication system in the party. Before that, he had also been the topic of discussions of his political role that resulted in an unanimous agreement that his being the President's son did not rob him of his right to practice politics like other citizens.
This is a fact that brooks no argument, and it means that Gamal Mubarak is facing a task that may look impossible, although he can succeed in it.
This will provide the young members of the National Democratic Party with real opportunities for voluntary social work.
The fourth and final element is to adopt a public attitude towards the State's approach to political issues or events by mobilizing university students for demonstrations in support of the Palestinian Intifada or in protestation against the American strikes against Afghanistan.
53-The Islamic Research Organization, which is the highest authority in Al Azhar, issued a statement containing a definition of jihad and fighting that has caused much debate in Cairo.
Prominent Muslim Brotherhood leader Dr Essam Al Eryan said that Al Azhar's definition of jihad agreed with the Muslim Brotherhood's point of view, although he described Al Azhar's action as having come "very late."
Meanwhile, Montasser Al Zayyat, lawyer of Islamic groups, said that the timing of Al Azhar's statement robbed the statement of the opportunity to gain credibility with those who followed other principles where jihad was concerned.
The beliefs of radical Muslims cannot be countered with a statement containing a few lines. It is better that the Islamic Research Organization open a large-scale dialogue on this issue and launch a debate with those who have rigid views.
He also ruled out the possibility that Al Azhar's statement would have any negative impact on the calls of radical fundamentalists, adding, "Perhaps the opposite will happen.
56-A number of Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan) Group leaderships in Egypt said Al- Taqwa bank did not belong to the group even though some of its co-founders were Ikhwanites. Asharq Al-Awsat interviewees declined to elaborate on the reasons for declaring the bank liquidated about two years ago. The American authorities have recently included the bank on the list of persons, corporations and organizations whose accounts had been frozen on a charge of involvement in terrorist activities or with terrorist groups.
Nigm said that the appeal against the freezing decision would be referred to national courts i.e. in Italy in the case of Al-Taqwa Bank as its was the central bank of Italy that informs the banks of the accounts to be frozen and it was it, too, that gathers reports and finally takes the decision.
Yesterday's arrests are the last ring of a long series of chases, which often ends in military court rulings against Ikhwan leaders at universities and professional associations. Such chases were started six years ago.
Thus, the message against the background of arrests appears to allow Arab brothers to take the same measures against anyone opposing the US campaign against Afghanistan so as to notch up the same goals of the Egyptian government. The goals include controlling the Egyptian street following the role played by Ikhwan activists in protests at universities and mosques against the attack on Afghanistan, and easing the US media campaign against Egypt.
Egypt's official position is against the violation of peaceable civilians' rights according to special US criteria, while it designedly applies extraordinary laws and measures, which were adopted only to fight against terrorism, to civilians.
Bin Barber said in Washington Times (November 6), "The Arab and Muslim allies could overcome the storms of protest staged by extremists in their countries.
The Israelis were and are still repeating that Jerusalem is the eternal single capital of Israel, while President Mubrak through the Oslo years repeated that "the fate of Jerusalem is negotiable" without knowing the seriousness of this statement, which left an impression that the Arabs and Muslims might cede some of their rights in Jerusalem.
60-MT / Al-Quds Al-Arabi, 10/11/2001
In a flat on the second floor of that building, the group's general guide, Mostafa Mashhour and his deputy, Counselor Maamoun Al-Hudheibi sit from the early morning till 2.00 p.m. monitoring the group's affairs, activities and the campaigns launched against its members. They read what the press publishes about the Ikhwan everywhere and watch the events transmitted by Arab and foreign satellite channels to detect any allusions to or expected impacts on thousands of Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and else where.
Street inhabitants do not mind having such a premises among them. Fear and worry came only after the USA had included Muslim Brotherhood on the terrorism list, thus considering them party to its anti-terrorism war and when the name of Taqwa Bank was mentioned as supplier of funds to Al-Qaeda Organization.

Q: What is the relation between forensic medicine and the new subject?
M.S. Al-Akhbar, 13/11/2001
Christine's story is a new one as she narrates it not out of Coptic pride in achieving distinction nor to point out Muslim pride in their creed.
Mr. Sulayman Al-Far, her teacher of Arabic in Port Said school was impressed by her performance in Arabic in spite of Koranic quotations such a performance involved, hence her choice of the Faculty of Education, Arabic department. My colleagues as well as my teachers noticed my distinction in the second year as I was the only student who got the grade of excellence. When I was promoted to the third year and had to specialize, I was worried as I thought the university would object to my joining in that section as I was the first Christian who wants to join it. My department professors as well as the faculty dean, nevertheless, showed great understanding.
I, for instance, wrote a paper on embroylogy and all my scientific proofs came from the holy Koran.
For the first time, the Eighth Bench of South Cairo Court will hear, on 22 December, a Khula' lawsuit (divorce of wife for consideration payable by her, ed.) filed by a Christian lady asking for separating herself from her husband and waiving her legitimate rights.
It might be mentioned that the couple are Christians, but they belong to different denominations.
Asharq Al-Awsat learnt that the Church defence would sue the defrocked monk for LE2001 as indemnity in compensation for the irrevocable material and moral harm done to the Church.
An Egyptian scientist has discovered two substances that, once mixed with water at very low quantities, turn it into ice, and the frozen mixture can keep its icy texture and the water inside it for up to 100 days.
The two substances can play an important role in different agricultural processes, as the main and secondary nutritional elements can be added to the treated water, turning its icy texture into a fertilizer that can be injected near trees and shrubs, such as peach, apple, olive and fig trees and other trees, including fruit trees and others. Injecting this mixture near trees will supply them with the water and nutrition they need for at least a hundred days."
In conclusion, they praised themselves and declared "victory" in the research, with Israel's Vice-Chief of Staff Mose Ya'loun terming the ongoing war against the Intifada as the most important one since 1948.
Although we have not completely provided security, we have made major achievements in this field and liquidated scores of Palestinian "terrorist cells".
* Preventing the development of battles with Palestinians into a regional war.
However, not all the attendees accepted Ya'loun's statements and largely blasted him for exaggerated self-laudation, reminding him that the war has now claimed the lives of 199 Israelis. They also made it certain that the Israeli masses enjoy neither safety nor security and that a number of cabinet ministers and army leaders do not live safely for the time being, pointing to an existing gap between military and political leaders, especially between Premier Ariel Sharon and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, in Israel regarding the war.
On 10 November, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres admitted that he had not "a peace plan" in his package.
In response to the criticism and accusations levelled by the Israeli right to the effect that he gives Palestinian President Yasser Arafat the life belt, Peres said: "Sharon is also supporting the establishment of a Palestinian State.
HAH Asharq Al-Awsat, 11/11/2001
Praising the stand of the Lebanese Government, particularly that of the three Presidents, which he described as "a clear, brave loyal stand for rejecting the attempt to brand Hizbullah as a terrorist organization," he described the US Administration as "stupid and insolent," adding, "Hizbullah's only crime is that it fought Israel."

Under the proposed amendments, the CBE will supervise foreign exchange companies, issue their licenses and follow them up through monetary policy follow-up committees and the setting up of a committee to study grievances and penalties.
The government is mulling over the use of some international experiments in this respect in setting the controls and criteria of this establishment so as to keep bank deposits, and determining its activities whether they will be inside or outside the Egyptian market, Al- Alam Al-Youm learnt.
The establishment will be interested in doubtful debts rather than bad ones, he added.
The sources pointed out that the increase of dirty money laundering in Egypt resulted from failure to investigate clients who deposit large sums with banks and the unknown origin of such funds.

SCENES OF TERRORISM
He said that during his detention (by Kuwaiti authorities), he had been badly abused, as his captors had "plucked hairs from his beard," flogged him with chains and put him on a grill in a bid to force out a confession that he had killed the Canadian.
Terrorism is the worst degree of injustice, but injustice does not justify injustice.
There is no doubt that some members of the Islamist trend are to blame partially for this dilemma, but, as Allah the Almighty says in the Holy Quran, "No bearer of burdens can bear the burden of another, S17 A15." The recent incidents are no justification for insuring justice and security through injustice and generalization.

MT / Asharq Al-Awsat, 14/11/2001
This campaign is spearheaded by writers from the United States and some Western countries, particularly Britain, most of whom are notorious for their extremist orientations and Zionist ideological tendencies and have wielded considerable influence in American decisionmaking circles.
The writers who lead this campaign have openly urged the US Administration to pressure the Saudi Royal Family into suppressing the imams, even arresting those among them who oppose US policies, changing textbooks, freezing the bank accounts of Islamic charities, under the pretext of their involvement in financing terrorism, and stopping all forms of official Saudi support, moral or material, to Islamic movements that used to receive support from the Royal Family.
While we still do not know the real reasons that make the American Administration turn in such a manner on its greatest ally in the Arabian Gulf region, we do know at least that the United States seeks to monopolize the whole world and control its destiny and wealth while it enters the twenty-first century.
Meanwhile, the Saudi Royal Family is trying to shore its position against the torrential currents in the United States, sometimes by succumbing and others by resistance, depending on the balances of power within the Family itself.
Saudi officials may be aware that the suffering of the Iraqi people in particular and the tragedy of the Palestinian people and the Kingdom's feeble positions in both cases over the past years have made Saudi Arabia a target for the wrath of Muslims, who now feel comfortable of sorts when they read the defaming stories that are promulgated in the West about the Kingdom and its people.
In the past few days, the American Administration received new, important and accurate information about Usama Bin Laden, the sources said, pointing out that the Americans got this new information from military and security officials, who dissented from Taliban Movement and were interrogated by the American CIA agents in Afghanistan. The Americans also got the information from Pashton leaders, who rebelled against Taliban, Pakistani bodies and Hameid Meir, a famous Pakistani journalist who met Bin Laden before the fall of Kabul and interviewed him. The sources said this information uncovers political matters related to Usama Bin Laden, his current situation and future plans, most prominent of which are: 	First, Usama Bin Laden told a number of people, close and loyal to him, that he is living his last weeks or days. He rejects being killed by the Americans or one of the Afghani opposition members.
Fourth, since the fall of Mazar-e Sherif and Kabul, Bin Laden has been unable to move from one place to another in Afghanistan with his armed force, formed of 200 non- Afghan Muslims, who belong to Al-Qaeda Organization. He moves with a small group of guards, companions and family members. He no longer feels safe and is unable to move easily between one area and another in Afghanistan, as he used to do in the past.
Can he and his senior aides be killed within days following the collapse of Taliban regime? The American officials refuse to fix a certain or even approximate time for getting rid of Bin Laden. However, the well-informed American diplomatic sources told Al-Watan that the American and British Special Forces were chasing Bin Laden and his senior assistants. This operation is made easier than before thanks to the collapse of Taliban and the control of the forces, which antagonize Taliban and Bin Laden, over most of the Afghani areas.
The third factor is the keenness of the Pashton leaders, whether from Taliban or from outside them, to show their loyalty to the leadership. This will actually urge them to look for Bin Laden.
Congressman Darrell Eissa (R) said that the delegation would take that "guaranty" that Hizbullah had a limited scope back to American officials, so that the two governments might work on defining it.
LEBANON WISHES AMERICA WOULD NOT CONTRIBUTE TO SHAKING ITS ECONOMY!
The sources added that an American official who had received the Lebanese government message asked whether Lebanon had a concept of a means to solving the problem of the three wanted persons.
Hizbullah Secretary General, Hassan Nasrallah said that, "The USA wants to exploit incidents to open many files in the world not only the resistance files in Lebanon". He pointed out that when America comes to our region, it looks at our files through Israeli eyes in order to meet Israeli demands and strip the Lebanese of elements of power.
He pointed out that the matter was not one of Hizbullah, but rather of, "whether there would be a strong Lebanon or no Lebanon at all." Lebanon is still in the circle of Israeli threats.
According to well-informed political sources, there are some obstacles to the anticipated American stepping up against Hezbollah, some of which might be linked to American interests themselves.
The Lebanese government would have to stand by the party in the face of any pressure while Syrian ability to influence the party might be reduced to a minimum compared with the current standard.
HALF-HEARTED SCRAMBLING IS NOT ENOUGH!
So long as Washington, after September 11th intervenes with even educational curricula amendments in some countries like Yemen to cancel what it considers incitement of terrorism, it is not surprising that it may exercise pressure as certain countries which only a few weeks before were classified as "enemies", may reshape their foreign policies.
Confrontation with Bush, according to the new dictionary of "War against terrorism" means siding with terrorism who the world has been vying to ostracise!
The Arabs might be in for a new loss - Iran which Washington would accept only in the context of an integrated vision of anti-terrorism wars where no struggle can be acquitted of violence and incitment. Any sympathizing with it would be forbidden.
AMERICA ON A BED OF THORNS Al Sayed Hani wrote from Islamabad: At long last, the United States has begun to realize how wrong it was in its calculations on Afghanistan!
The proof is that the leaders of the Northern Alliance refused to meet with the American envoy to Afghanistan on 18 November. The man had been dispatched to Afghanistan to take part in the efforts for forming an expanded Afghan government to fill the vacuum created by the absence of the Taliban in Kabul, but he failed to meet with any of the senior leaders of the Northern Alliance.
When they sent an envoy to Afghanistan, nobody would meet with him!
The United States will most likely follow the latter course of action, thus giving Afghanistan to the Russians on a silver platter, so that they may enter it with Godspeed after having been driven out of it in defeat 12 years ago!
As to the Americans and the British, the presence of their forces in Afghanistan has become a cause of displeasure for the Northern Alliance, to quote General Fahih.
In a statement issued by the American embassy in Cairo, Welsh said that the USA government would be pleased to help Egypt overcome the current deficit in its annual budget, ensuing from a retreat in government revenues from tourism.

AMERICAN PROGRAM FOR COMBATING EXTREMISM IN EGYPTIAN SCHOOLS

It is noteworthy that the Ministry of Economy included the sectors of banking, budget, the minister's office, companies, follow-up and securities and investment, while the Ministry of Foreign Trade included the sectors of Commercial representation body, export control, Export Development Center and the Exhibitions Authority.

The Arab League took the initiative - holding the conference - and hoped that the Arab action should face up to any potential threat, Moussa added. Anticipation is of no avail as we should wait until this threat is explicit. It is obvious that there are precursors, especially as the civilization conflict is theoretically present, he said. However, such precursors may turn into reality and succeed in controling the world just as the Zionist idea which had been made light of by some, then it turned into a reality, Moussa pointed out.
He continued, saying, "You must try to bring back those who do not practice religious rites to the fold of the religion, particularly as we know how the Christians loathe our religion and hate the Holy Quran."

The expert wondered, "What prevents Arafat from arresting all the fundamentalists and banning their groups? They are forcing him to choose between extremely bad options, the least damaging of which is expulsion and elimination of the Palestinian Authority and all its bodies, which would be exploited by Ariel Sharon for more destruction and killing."

39-ISRAELI DEFENCE MINISTER VISIT TO CAIRO CANCELLED
In case the visit was through or not, the Israeli Defence Minister had nothing interesting to present especially as the Israeli government chose going ahead on its way of destroying the peace process and all steps resulting from Madrid Conference.

During a meeting he held with the three committees members, he added that he was afraid Egypt's relations with those countries would be exposed to set backs. He warned against giving full rein to one's emotions or abusing some major powers especially the USA.
47-A few days ago, the first legal and judicial agreement was signed by Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher and his American counterpart Colin Powell. The agreement aims at cooperation in defining the whereases of those required for investigation, evidence and information exchange and access to defendants' depositions documents and registers.
He thinks that the agreement would be unilaterally valid as we will give America access to everything but will receive nothing in return. No country has ever chosen to transfer its sovereignty over its citizens to another.
- The agreement will be unilateral contract of submission entitling America to large portions of information denying Egypt access to the same right.
- The agreement must be referred not only to the People's Assembly but to Egyptian public opinion as it represents a fatal blow to national sovereignty and the liberty of Egyptians. An Embarrassing Business!
Terrorist America! For his part, People's Assembly opposition deputy, Al-Badri Farghali said that America is reformulating new laws for the world and it, therefore, wants to impose its judicial, security, and economic control and become the undisputed policeman and judge of the world!

The party started with a fierce attack by Hassan Hussein, Secretary of the Nasserite Party in Alexandria, on the alterations made by the United States in Christian rites, thereby substituting a rabbi for a priest in one of the churches. Attributing this action to the Americans' submission to the Zionists, Hassan Hussein called for a meeting of intellectuals and scholars to lay down a strategy against what the West was doing to the Arab Nation, including Muslims and Christians.

Islam takes into consideration the psychological and physiological differences between man and woman, but it protects women's rights."

The draft laws include issues like combating money laundering, practicing the auditing profession, streamlining of banking procedures of real estate mortgage, special economic zones, unified labour law, taxes and chambers of commerce. The draft law on combating money laundering aims at taking stock of money collected as a result of illegal work. It includes some main axes that criminalize illicit money laundering operations as crimes in their own right including every act that involves earning money, investing, and remitting it with a view to concealing its source or changing its reality to avoid disclosing that it is collected from one of the aforementioned crimes.
The unified labour bill aims at regulating the employment of workers inside and outside the country as well as work contracts.
Concerning the draft law on taxes, it concentrates on striking tax justice.
The fresh bill, he said, will not include any exemptions to exporters as international foundations are opposed to the Egyptian government tendency to grant tax exemptions to export and manufacture activities. Instead, the government will take stimulant actions for exporters, starting with a 4-million-pound fund financed by the state public budget, the minister added.
At the symposium, Gamal said some companies and economic foundations, which were polled to express their opinions on the question, made it certain that they do not give priority to this issue. These companies should have a developed infrastructure at the private economic areas and a high-level administration and should combat bureaucracy.
The Tax Department has received proposals from diverse categories of taxpayers as to the fresh bill, he added. But, following the consideration of such proposals, it was made clear that if they were put in force, the State budget deficit would increase up to 12 billion pound per annum, the minister added.

This bill will be discussed by the People's Assembly during its forthcoming session. "The second law is the telecommunications regulation law, which will lay down controls for regulating the telecommunications industry and procedures for dealing with investors in this field, so as to provide room for competition and insure good services. It will also regulate the use of the frequency spectrum. The third law is the bill on development of the information technology industry, which will set forth the mechanisms of this industry. Being different from other industries, the information technology industry cannot be treated like factories, particularly as it depends on thinking and brains."

22-ZAYED COORDINATION & FOLLOW-UP CENTRE WARNS AGAINST ISRAELI DEAD SEA CANAL PROJECT
The study discusses all the details of this serious project, including a historical background that covers the history of the project since 1850, when it was a British imperialist project aimed at countering the Suez Canal project, which was one of the first objectives of the French Expedition to Egypt (1798-1801) but was proclaimed only in 1846, when a society for Suez Canal studies was established in Paris. It tells how Zionist gangs took over the British project, consequently occupying Umm Al Rishrash (now Eilat), in violation of UN Security Council resolutions 54, 56 and 61 for 1948, so as to have an outlet on the Red Sea through which goods and petroleum would flow from Africa and Asia into Europe. generally speaking, the Dead Sea Canal Project, which is designed along the lines of the British project and for which Israel is now looking for funding, shows that Israel has not intention of returning to the 4 June 1967 borders.

More than a half-century earlier, the United Nations adopted a resolution in 1947 for establishing two states: one Jewish on 52% of the land of Palestine, and the other Palestinian on 48% of the land.
However, this is unacceptable to both Arabs and Muslims, because it is impossible for Jerusalem to be under Israeli sovereignty.
Among these things are Jerusalem, settlements, expansion, return of refugees and reparations to them, borders, Armed Forces and water, all of which are well-known, which makes Arabs wonder about what could Powell, the important American Secretary, say about this dilemma, which all the world wants to solve, except Israel, which apparently does not want to see it unraveled.
He pointed out that his country was applying a reform and development process according to a policy of its own, despite the fact that it had shouldered huge defense burdens and was facing tremendous political pressures and serious security challenges.
30-BASHIR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALLY PROTESTS UGANDAN PRESIDENT'S CALL TO "DIVIDE SUDAN BETWEEN ARABS AND AFRICANS"
Serageddin termed the SPLA as being a "terrorist group, not a liberation movement". The Sudanese diplomat regarded that Uganda's sustained support for the SPLA and Mosevini's recent negative statements in the United States on dividing Sudan between Arabs and Africans, constitute a setback to efforts to normalize relations between both countries.
34-Major General (retired) Salah Eddin Selim wrote: Today, Egypt and Sudan face the gravest political and military situation to exist in the southern part of the Nile Valley since the Sudanese civil war broke out in southern Sudan in 1983. The forces of John Garang's rebel movement, the SPLM, controls most of Sudan's borders with its neighbours except Egypt and Libya, and it also controls almost all of Bahr Al Ghazal province. If the SPLM captures Juba or Wau, it plans to proclaim a secessionist Christian minor state with the blessing of the United States, Uganda, Rwanda and probably Kenya, too.
The Mossad also played an active role in frustrating the Cairo Agreement, bribing and arming some Somalese tribal militias, and the agreement failed to stop the civil war, which has destroyed the Muslim Somalese state so severely that the country will not stand on its feet again before many years, if ever. The Gulf Arabs have also been reluctant to make any diplomatic overtures in Somalia or provide financial support to help national reconciliation in that country as a result of direct American pressure.
I recall here the agreement between Uganda and Israel in 2000 to erect hydraulic projects along Uganda's northeastern border with Sudan to change the course of 2.5 billion cubic metres of water that flows into the Nile Valley.
Iraqi knowledgeable sources affirmed that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein gave his second son Qusai further competence, such as responding to Presidential headquarters correspondence. The step is meant to alleviate the pressure on Saddam and train Qusai in running the internal affairs of the country when Saddam is absent from work due to his bad health, or if he is hidden in case Iraq is exposed to an American attack. It might be mentioned that Qusai became a member in the country leadership of the Baath Party last May.

43-The USA managed to revive the "Smart Sanctions" project when the UN Security Council unanimously agreed to amend the current system of sanctions when those sanctions are reconsidered in May next.
The Iraqi ambassador in Ankara, Farouk Higazi has also denied his summoning to Iraq being the result of Turkish pressure or any political difference between the two countries.
In spite of the pledge given by Washington to Russia that the sanction modification would synchronize with a "comprehensive solution" to the sanctions issue, the matter remained linked to the USA policy towards the Iraqi regime, a policy linked to the proliferation of mass destruction weapons that was connected with the terrorism issue after the September 11th incidents.
In a lengthy dialogue published by Al-Mussawar magazine, Gamal Mubarak said that Mubarak listened to both official and unofficial advisors. He added that the President had his own way of contacting many specialists in various issues and never contented himself with listening to just one point of view.
Are we ready for that system now while we are preoccupied with trying to develop the People's Assembly election technique in order to avoid some negative points and cut to size the influence of money? If, however, money plays a role in P.A. elections, a role which is likely to increase in the next elections, what, then, would be the influence of money in the Presidential elections not only from the interior but from foreign countries as well.

21-M.S. Al-Hayat, 4/12/2001
It is estimated that there are around 8,000 Afghans in the Horn of Africa, of whom 4,000 melted into the region's communities.
The US and the West were concerned over such groups' moves ahead of the aborted attempt.
It could plug the vacuum resultant from the absence of a state, especially in the fields of judiciary, trade and educational institutions. It is also regarded the backbone of the Somali para-states.
The Somali Islamic Union, which was listed by the US as a terrorist organization, was closely related to Al-Qaeda newtork, led by Osama Bin Laden.
The Eritrean task forces fought the Somali Islamic Union, which was waging a guerilla warfare in the eastern part in Ethiopia. Eritrea's forces were the first to infiltrate into the Somali territories to chase and hunt the union activists in a first coordinated security action between Asmara and Addis Ababa before the deterioration of bilateral relations between them.
It was natural for the September 11 events to cast their shadow over the Horn of Africa, which is accused of generating anti-US hegemony Islamic groups.
Thus, the main wanted (Bin Laden) has become a hero in the Horn of Africa.
It is also qualified to perform this role as it has close relationships with Somali provinces and has an influence in Mogadishu.

"Who is the civilian and who is the military?" the Mufti wondered adding that the murdered Palestinian civilians, including children and women, are many times as many as those fighters falling martyrs during the Intifada. Schoolchildren's bodies were ripped and pregnant women were banned from reaching hospitals, thus the mother and the foetus died in many cases. So, why did not mass media highlight these pictures?

35-WE HAVE TO SAY NO HERE, MR PRESIDENT?
There is only one way out for President Arafat, and a face-saving one at that.

After the technical American team headed by the Coordinator of Sudanese Affairs in the State Department concluded its five-day visit to Sudan this week, during which it discussed the proposals of Danforth, how do the different parties in Sudan view the mission of the American envoy and the role and objectives that the United States seeks in Sudan?
He believes that the current American Administration has realized the errors of the containment policy that the former administration had followed towards the Sudanese Government. He said, "The current shift of the US Administration from supporting the anti- government factions in Sudan to making bids for stopping the war is a positive step. But the real problem lies in the anti-Sudan environment that the American lobbies have created, as well as in the current debate between two wings in the US Administration, one of which wants to brandish a bludgeon in the face of anyone who opposes America's foreign policy, while the other believes in the need for disciplined American behaviour. I hope that the voice of reason will prevail where Sudan is concerned."

BANQUE DE CAIRE, MISR BANQUES, BANK OF ALEXANDRIA MERGED INTO ONE MAMMOTH ENTITY
The study noted that Banque Misr president, Bahaa Eddin Helmy had hailed the idea of having the three banks amalgamated. Helmy, according to the study, sees that the presence of a branch of Banque De Caire in the Gulf and another one of Banque Misr in Europe triggers off activity integration of the two banks and leads to a slump in its costs.
What is important is not the number of banks but the volume of their activity, dealings and capital credit worthiness.
According to the assignment sent by the Ministry to the privatization project "Price Water House", the contributions of Banque Misr, that was decided to be put up for sale, exist in 6 joint companies as follows: LE33 million in Bank of Commerce and Development (Al-Tegaryoon) at a rate of 16% of the bank's capital, LE6 million or 99.9% of Al-Amriya for Yarn and Textiles' capital, LE15.8 million or 15.2% of the National Company for Syndicates Housing, LE5.9 million or 9.8% of the National company for Corn Products, LE250 thousand or, 25% of Ismailia- Misr for Refrigeration and LE19.2 million or 80% of Misr for Refrigeration and Storage.

To make the market more active and eradicate recession, the government decided to decrease the rate of interest at banks and approved the application of the second and third stages of the sales tax, which would result in higher commodity and service prices, lower demand and deepening stagnation and lull.
Before being issued, fresh legislation and decrees have to be put for large-scale deliberations, just as the government did concerning the mortgage draft law, he urged. This approach can make businessmen and others abide by laws, bring a legislative stability and avoid amendments, which are frequently introduced to laws, he said. State departments and authorities have to work together to find a way out of lull and stagnation at the market, he added.
Chairman of Alkantara Sharq investors society, Fuad Thabet said the zone projects suffer from a host of problems the most prominent of which are the cutting off of electricity more than once a week, insufficient electrical capacity at present, high prices of electricity linkage, loading down investors with additional burdens via the use of more costly electricity linkage requirements to do away with commodity stockpile in the electricity company.
Al Haddad Food stuff company Board Chairman, Mekkawi Haddad said the cutting off of the electrical current during the last period inflicted many losses to the tune of LE200000 due to the damage of raw materials used in manufacturing ice cream.
Al-Alam Al-Youm also learnt that the preparations aiming at attracting a strategic investor for the stable and third mobile phone networks, didn't mean backtracking on the public tender for the company's shares which the government chose to put off due to inappropriate circumstances on the international market.

Egyptian-Indian commercial and economic relations have not risen to the high level of political and historical relations.
Al-Alam Al-Youm weekly broached such questions in the form of one question: What are the untraditional ideas required for cementing the Indian-Egyptian traditional friendship?!
"We expect Indian investments in Egypt to reach about $800 million in the coming few years.
However, the official took great care to use highly cautious diplomatic phraseology while voicing his own remarks.
Third, the construction of Indian companies in Egypt does not only give India access to bigger contribution to the Egyptian economy, but also encourages foreign Egyptian trade and technological development in its industrial sector. The foundation of Alexandria for Black Carbon Company, and the new proposal of setting up fertilizer production units are just one example bearing evidence to Indian technological capabilities.
Sixth, although some parties encourage economic and commercial cooperation, each party has to be well familiarized with the available opportunities in each country and contribution by private sector in both countries should also be encouraged within the framework of economic cooperation.
First, the restructuring of the Egyptian-Indian Business Council and Egyptian-Indian Joint Chamber of Commerce.
"So, I prefer the separation of subcommittees, so that each one may be independent and affiliated to the ministry which supervises its activity.
Fifth, work costs in Egypt should be reduced through reducing the Suez Canal tolls and banks commissions on lading documents.
She added that overcoming such a deficit, would not only be achieved by boosting Egyptian exports to India, but also by having India an investment partner to Egypt. This could be achieved through founding joint investment projects whose production would be totally exported.
RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT SECURES PAYMENT OF EGYPTIAN EXPORTERS' DUES
Shetaa asked Egyptian exporters to pay attention to product quality and amend prices. He pointed out that the Egyptian products are not competitive in terms of prices.

He underlined the importance of Egypt as principal commercial partner of Poland in Africa, particularly after Egypt joined the COMESA, thus serving as a conduit for Polish products to the African market. Poland also, he added, plays the same role for Egypt in Europe especially as Poland would be an EU member state in a few years' time, thus serving as a conduit for the Egyptian products to Europe.

1.		ARAB LEADERS HANDS WASHED OF PALESTINIAN BLOOD
We want them together with their peace partners to persuade Israel to relieve the brunt of occupation until God Almighty bestows His Clemency and brings about an end to them and their likes! All the world have been up in arms to rescue the Bosnians, Kosovos and Iraqi Kurds. The whole world rallied to face the disaster that befell Eastern Timor inhabitants. The Western Desert problem never failed to arouse international concern; neither did the crises in Rwanda, Burundi or south Sudan!
We know that some people do not discountenance what is going on there, while others are quite pleased with it as they see in it a profitable chance for overbidding to win cases of their own concern!

48.		WEAPONS COMPANIES LAUNCH "SECOND" COLD WAR IN THE GULF
52.		It has also become apparent through that exhibition that the second cold war has already followed in the steps of the first one, adopting almost the same scenario. Big powers would race for providing smaller countries with weaponry, while avoiding direct confrontation between major powers. They, in a sense, have joined an unsigned contract or agreement that tension and wars would be the lot of smaller countries to export weapons to them.
On the same string, the American expert Neil Patrick harps alleging that there were no fears of Israel while the gravest danger lies in Iraq. He then claims there would be a bigger danger still as Iran might either with external assistance or depending on its own in the field of ballistic missiles launch a nuclear offensive somewhere in the region in the next decade.

67.		IMMINENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ARAB ISRAELI CONFLICT!
71.		The Israeli army is convinced that it is necessary to prevent Hamas and Jihad from carrying out any planned or successive operations against military and civil targets and therefore preemptive strikes should be launched against their bases, their members should be pursued and the Palestinian National Authority should be pressurized in order to arrest further numbers of them.
74.		The more plausible option, therefore of both Israeli minister of defence and chief of staff would be the launching of a lighting strike or military operation in two directions, firstly against south Lebanon, and Al-Bekaa valley, secondly against occupied Palestine through sweeping Ramallah city, the main economic centre in the Palestinian National Authority lands or one or some of the main Palestinian cities like Hebron and Jericho or part of Gaza Strip itself.
78.		In the meantime, there must be effective economic pressure appropriately activating economical boycotting and reducing diplomatic representation of some Arab countries in Tel Aviv to a minimum and stopping oil and natural gas exports from some Arab countries to the Zionist state.
83.		The Arabs are much stronger than they may imagine.
85.		Such a message could remind Bush that the American Jews worked on bringing his father down in 1992, on behalf of Israel. They even paid the costs of the presidential election campaigns of Clinton and Al Gore. Eighty percent of the votes were against the Republican candidate.

98.		For his part, the new Israeli minister enthusiastically received the order and deemed it his first ministerial priority for it will greatly serve Russian Jews.
100.	However, the fresh project is palpably based on political and ethnic motives which are as serious as colonial settlement in the West Bank, Jerusalem, Golan Heights in Syria and Gaza Strip.
But, Israel occupied Galilee as a whole as far as Lebanon's borders in the north and Syria in the east, controlled over 95 percent of Arab territories and placed them at the disposal of government bodies according to a set of unfair laws (14 laws exactly) prescribed for the purpose.
As soon as Jews get there, they enjoy protection from the police and intelligence services against any potential Arab "attacks".
102.		Israeli governments have been gripped in concern over this demographic equation since 1949, the year of setback. This equation deems the question an Israeli internal affair on the grounds that Galilee is part of Israeli land and population Arab and Jewish are Israeli citizens. It also looks at Arabs as aliens at the area although they are the original residents and deems Arab offspring a menace to the Jewish presence.

48- In its expansionist campaign that witnessed over 30 massacres, Israel expelled the inhabitants of 420 villages (completely deleted from the map) and 15 cities and turned homeless 800 thousand refugees who now hit 4 millions. The dispossession operation is still on especially after the Israelis openly voiced fears of the Palestinians' steady increase. The dispossession policy has, therefore, become legal so long as democracy is abided by, to quote one of their thinkers.
50- I wish that Egyptian and Arab replies to the Israelis would make it quite clear that we hate such aggressiveness and mobilize our masses to cultivate that hatred in their hearts.

Al Ahrar learned that the articles of the proposed law will stipulate that only those goods that comply with specifications and have certain levels of quality will be allowed into the country.
It will also require all importers, including merchants, manufacturers and producers, to quote the exact or average finance value of their annual imports, so as to rationalize consumption and determine the exact figures of imports instead of the present state of haphazard importation.
41-The Chairman of the Federation of Chambers of Commerce, Khalid Abu Ismail, said that it had been decided to adopt a set of important measures for regulating garment imports, now that the ban on them would be lifted as of 1 January 2002.
Egypt has the right to lay down conditions and specifications for such imports. Importers of Egyptian products, particularly agricultural goods, apply the same health, environment and quality measures and monitor the Egyptian units that produce the items they import, as well as the land where the crops they import are grown, such as potato and orange."
Mr. Mustafa Zaki asserts that importation is almost suspended at present due to the repercussions of the war on terrorism and the rise in the maritime freight, at a time when Egypt imports about 60% of its needs from abroad. Besides, the private sector imports all capital goods necessary for manufacture.

What is the future of Egypt's foreign exchange reserves?
The question now is: Will the Central Bank continue to cover the difference between demand and supply of foreign currencies, and will its new status enable it to adopt a policy that will be different from that it followed in the past?"
Ali Negm called for implementation of one of his old proposals, namely linking the Egyptian pound to a currency basket to create a balance of exchange rates. He said, "Our problem is that the input of foreign exchange from the established sources is low. The drop in resources will continue if the current situation persists, and the input of local currency will also be affected by such a situation.

71-A recent economic study published by the Egyptian Public Authority for Specifications and Quality Assurance stressed the importance of compliance with international specifications (ISO) for motor vehicles and using such specifications as a unified reference for all Arab States. Should unified specifications for the auto industry not exist at Arab level, an Arab committee should be formed to examine the relevant French, British, Japanese, German and American specifications and choose the most suitable of them as a unified reference for preparing Arab specifications, the study suggested.
The study also indicated that the number of new vehicles registered in world countries every year totaled some 40 million and that the size of the world auto market would increase from some 720 million vehicles this year to about 1 billion vehicles in 2020, explaining that that stupendous number of vehicles required supplying consumers with goods and services with characteristics that met their needs and expectations at the time they wanted such goods and services and at reasonable prices that they could afford.
"This surplus has been achieved through the non traditional measures that were applied by the units of the petroleum sector, as per the directives of the political leadership that this sector remain a main source of foreign exchange, particularly after the balance of payments deficit of FY 1998/99," he said.
77-The season of exporting Egyptian potatoes to European and Arab countries will start in the second half of this month. A total of 25 high-quality agricultural zones have been selected in Salehia, Nubaria, Ismailia and Sharkia to undertake exporting Egyptian potatoes.

3.		All expectations indicate that the phenomenon of buying votes will be more pronounced in the Shura Council elections, given the wider geographic boundaries of constituencies. Speculations indicate that a Shura Council seat will cost not less than LE 500,000 on average, with this figure going up or down according to the financial strength of the candidate. Ahmad Abu Zaid, Chairman of the People's Assembly's Arab Affairs Committee, blamed the businessmen who had run in the People's Assembly elections after having drenched their constituencies in money, which had encouraged voters who needed money to sell their votes to the highest bidder.

10.	 A certain belief has prevailed in Egyptian circles that the government imposed a freeze on the activities of syndicates and suspended elections for syndicate councils after the syndicates had turned into strongholds for the Muslim Brotherhood, which had managed to control the councils and impose itself on the Egyptian political scene. The Brotherhood's domination of professional syndicates synchronized with its absence from the People's Assembly, whose 1990 elections were boycotted by the Muslim Brotherhood, together with other political forces, in protestation against the government's failure to respond to their demands for political reform. Muslim Brotherhood candidates failed to win any seats in the 1995 parliamentary elections, which the Brotherhood claimed had been doctored to deny its candidates access to the People's Assembly.
14.		It is to be mentioned that the Ikhwan boycotted the previous Shura Council elections because it believed that the Council plays a formal role that does not affect legislation.

The Group also supported the Nasserite candidate Sameh Ashour for the post of the Bar Association chairman who won the seat at the expense of the NDP candidate Ragai Attiya.
20.		In Cairo, the Mufti of Egypt, Dr Nasr Farid Wassil, expressed amazement at the Taliban's declaration that all pre-Islam statues will be demolished, saying, "These statues are just a recording of history. They have no negative impact on the doctrine of Muslims."

On the other hand, the four candidates said that integration in French politics would not be at the expense of their belonging to Lebanon.

The deputies themselves pinpointed that there were several reasons why the current government should be toppled, especially its failure to meet the masses' hopes to get out of the current trade recession or to carry out monetary policies that would transcend the monetary crisis that had been caused by a previous government.

In an urgent statement to the Prime Minister Atef Ebeid to be discussed by the People's Assembly's Committee on Industry in its meeting on December 4th under the chairmanship of Dr Amin Mubarak, Fateh Al-Bab highlighted the importance that the government should settle the companies debts with banks, decrease the financial burdens and fix fair economic prices for energy elements.
Because of such hardships and hindrances, the assets that have been overdrawn hit LE2.399 billion, at a time when the company's total debts hit LE5.621 billion, of which LE2.675 billion are the total financial burdens sustained by the company as a result of works it carried out since 1990 till 2001. The company's dues on its clients hit LE907 million due to companies affiliated to the government and Public Enterprise Sector defaulting on the repayment of their debts which represent 73%, the deputy indicated.

In a message attached to the draft law, Minister of Foreign Trade, Youssef Botrous Ghali said the new amendment aimed at facilitating the procedures provided for in the Auction and Bid Act with regard to the CBE, for the banking activities undertaken by the Central Bank naturally required speed and flexibility that might not be materialized by such regulations.

Wafd Party Economic Committee chairman Ibrahim al-Desouqi Abaza said the current period sees a metamorphosed economic system, which has nothing to do with any known free, central or mixed economic systems.

Osama saad, member of the General Division of Importers at the Federation of Egyptian Chambers of Commerce said that the decision made importers buy the dollar for LE5 to meet their commitments but the dollar exchange rate went down afterwards hitting 430 piastres, which brought about gross losses to importers.
The matter was achieved in one stroke and it seemed as a preplanned action that has been ready to be enacted on the first sign.
The matter is represented as if the whole country will collapse as a top importer- exporter, who is close to the political authorities that made that class, put it. Naturally , the governor of the CBE had given a chance to those people because he, with his decrees, had actually harmed thousands of ordinary importers and traders beside them. Phone lines started becoming busy.
The dollar's rate is now 450 piasters.

In spite of economic milieus' optimism that defaulters' problems with banks and in many sectors could be solved, banks categorically refused to exchange defaulters' loans for the purchase of their real estate projects. This step is considered a new blow that complicated matters after the banks halted granting loans to new housing projects. It is noteworthy that banks had previously financed real estate investments. Furthermore, there are more than LE6.5-billion dues on Egyptian businessmen and investors who operate in the real estate field but who failed to pay off any part of their loans due to market conditions.
There has been growth in the volume of luxurious and tourist housing put up for sale while that of medium and low-cost housing is suffering a sharp decline, especially with the State's tendency to include government housing companies on the list of companies to be privatized.
The government spent LE14 billion on the infrastructure in the new cities. The infrastructure included water stations, sanitary drainage stations, power stations, telephones and roads. The area of housing land furnished with utilities hit 83 million square meters, allocated to individuals to set up buildings and villas as well as the housing projects implemented by the Ministry of Housing in addition to the land allocated to private sector companies to provide them with infrastructure.
In the meantime, the Ministry of Housing will soon approve a bill on the maintenance of the existing real estate projects and organization of demolishing operations of buildings.
Mohamed al-Abyadh, the section's chairman, told Al-Alam Al-Youm that the section planned to present a memo to CBE Governor Mahmoud Abul-Oyoun to provide fresh exchange mechanisms so as to head off any exchange crises in the foreseeable future.

Meanwhile, the informal exchange rate of the Saudi riyal, which has vanished from the market, has exceeded 135 piasters, while the official rate at exchange firms ranges between 113 piasters and 135 piasters for purchasing and 114 piasters for selling.
In exclusive statements to Al-Alam Al-Youm, Tayel said those contacts were made within the framework of the currently exerted efforts to weather the dollar crisis and the decrease in banks stocks of foreign exchange because of the September 11th incidents.
The government is considering with donor bodies the amendment of disbursing rules as per which Egypt used to get some of its dues in the form of commodities and services so that Egypt can get such dues in cash or through some other means that can be liquefied in foreign exchange, he said.
54-FEARS OF NEW INFLATIONARY WAVE ON THE EGYPTIAN MARKET FOLLOWING THE DOLLAR RATE FLUCTUATIONS
Zaki pointed out that the import market in Egypt is not confined to businessmen and the private sector which imports 60% at most of the volume of imports, while the remaining part is shared out by the government and Public Enterprise Sector companies. This acquits importers of part of the responsibility for imports in Egypt as the state is also partially responsible.

Dr. Baz says: "President Mubarak's visit to Moscow is an occasion for talking with the Russian leadership and institutions. We want East and West Europe as well as Russia, considered one of the sponsors of the peace process and a close country to the Middle East, to play an active role." "When we speak about a European-Russian role, we do not do this to tease the US or weaken or belittle the importance of its stance, as this role will remain important for us," says Dr. Baz. "It is in the interest of the Arabs to have an American stance that sympathizes to some extent with and understands the Arab requests," he adds.
"We advised the US Administration not to try or seek to topple the Iraqi regime because any attempt to do so from outside Iraq whether by foreign countries or forces, or by Iraqi opposition groups working under foreign umbrellas will lead to nothing. The topic of rule in Iraq should be left for the Iraqi people to decide on it," Al-Baz says.
"As for Libya and the crisis of Luckerbie, the way of dealings with Libya should change, especially as it has met all demands imposed on it during the crisis," he adds.

Incidentally, Murad was the only Egyptian pilot who witnessed the Israeli military planes bombing a Syrian radar station at Dhahr Al-Beidar area, to the east of Beirut last Monday.
This needed a good deal of self-control and discretion to deal with the situation. Murad told Al-Hayat that he listened to the control tower instructions and felt sure that only land attempt would constitute a threat to both the plane and its passengers.
For the second time, therefore, he came back to Cairo without passengers, which had exposed him in the first time to legal investigation before he was finally acquitted from the charge of remissness, thus returning all rights to him.

SHARON DECIDES TO WAGE WAR ON SYRIA & LEBANON
MSH/ Al-Ittihad, 16/4/2001
Consequently, such an action, in case it developed to have military dimensions, would have the US and Europe strongly step in the situation, which would make the parties particularly Syria snatch the chance to demand a comprehensive intervention that could control military actions in Palestine as well. This would be the biggest political strike at Sharon's illusions, which make us feel he is not really fit for political action.
It seems that it would not be long before the Arab League (AL) and Israel merge into one regional entity whether it will be called the AL, the Middle East Organization for Security and Cooperation or any other appellation. The question of having Israel join the AL is not a sort of "political fantasy." Rather, it is a "blunt" expression of the facts about the "blunter" Arab conditions.
AL Secretary General Dr. Esmat Abdel-Meguid responded that that matter was totally rejected and impossible. It would not be allowed whatever the challenges and pressures might be. Moreover, late Syrian president Hafez Assad refused to discuss this proposal, saying that he would by no means accept it.
Late king Hussein of Jordan spoke about this idea, saying that it might take place, but in due course. "Due course" according to the late king was the achievement of comprehensive, just and final peace.
Rather, it will be: "What would happen if Israel refused to join the AL?"
The Movement also called for the introduction of the multi-party system, the establishment of official parties, and the formation of a government that enjoys parliamentary majority and that takes decisions according to the majority of the ministers' votes.

The Movement urged the Royal Family to bring closer good entourage and keep away bad companions. The Movement also asked the Family to settle differences among the leading figures without allowing the opportunists and foreign parties to interfere.

Therefore, the rules of the club prevent any person from entering into the place, unless he has an advance date with the host.

The member can sit individually or with his friends. He can order any kind of food he likes and listens to any kind of music he prefers.
It is the right of every member to determine the décor of the place where he wants to sit - ancient Arabian model, modern European model, or the in-between model.
The list is long, as it carries the names of the most famous of the famous.
92-If a non-member enters the club, he will be taken aback. If he belongs to the ordinary people, he may lie in a coma or feel that the land is shaking under him.

Minister of Finance, Medhat Hassanin disclosed the possibility that his ministry might backtrack on implementing the new customs tariff in case those amendments were turned down by the People's Assembly or WTO.
The minister pointed out that the new customs amendments imposed on ready-made clothes were applied as per the presidential decree which had been issued in that respect and in light of the continuation of the decision on banning importation of garments. So, the introduction of such amendments will be confined at present to the garments bought from Port Said or brought by those coming from abroad, he said.
The committee's main task concentrates on combatting all sources of customs evasion.
On January 3rd, Prime Minister Atef Ebeid held an extensive Cabinet meeting attended by Port Said Governor, Mostafa Kamel and the MPs of the governorate. During this meeting, the position of Port Said as a free zone was discussed in light of the decisions recently issued by finance minister concerning the new customs tariff imposed on 1100 fully-manufactured imported commodities.
Port Said is qualified for this strategy as it has an agricultural activity in the vicinity of 135,000 feddans, in addition to industrial and mining activities, Kamel added. Another decision, that has been agreed upon is that Port Said will be put on Egypt's map of industry through the garment factories. This will be supported through Port Said development fund. By so doing, Port Said will be an industrial city within 5 years and ended as a free zone city, he said.
On January 4th, Port Said governorate was shocked following the announcement that the city's free zone would be cancelled within five years and changed into an industrial zone.

Government disputes have cropped up over a draft law put forward by the Ministry of Finance to convert state authorities into holding companies.

M.S. Al-Ittihad, 15/1/2002
As soon as the CBE cuts the value of the national currency to a rate lower than the black-market one without having the ability to decisively support the rate it sets to answer the market needs, speculators fathom out this measure in a different way, imagining that moving the rate came as giving in to foreign pressure and thereupon they directly raise the US dollar rate of exchange against the pound just as happened on January 15, when the black-market US dollar selling price spiraled up to 530 piasters against the slight decline in the pound.

MFA, Asharq Al Awsat, 14/1/2002
The spokesman of the G-17, Dr Mohammad Al Morsi, told Asharq Al Awsat that the main feature of the Government's statement was the marginalization of the economic issues that concerned the ordinary citizen.

Further, it did not talk about the instability of the Egyptian pound against other currencies or the problem of the depreciation of the pound by 30% in only 5 months and how the Government planned to handle this crisis.

Al-Sheikh Ahmed said that the organization wanted to accurately define the sources of extremism and terrorism and present the international public opinion with correct replies pointing out Islam's rejection of such phenomena and the role of Islamic moderate and centrist thought in resisting and containing them.

In a report, it affirmed that the practical application of the statute according to the second and third stages of the sales tax unveiled by the end of the year running - and only after five months of the introduction of the sales tax law at the stage of wholesale and retail - that the statute had dropped the advantage of exempting producers and merchants from refunding the sales tax in return for the conditional cash discount they carried out on their sales.

The number of garment factories reach roughly 330, where about 20 percent of the total manpower in Egypt are employed and whose investments amount to 85 billion pounds, he said. In this context, garment producers should be given privileges and exemptions, which enable them to preserve their quotas at the domestic market and boost their competitive edge at foreign markets.

MT / Asharq Al-Awsat, 25/12/2001
Algeria: The Islamic map in Algeria looks different than elsewhere. In Algeria, we have a country that has paid in blood for the war between civilization and the extremists, a war that, while it has not yet reached an end, has produced Islamic parties that now share in government, such as the Peace Community Movement (Hams) and Al Nahda Movement, as well as other tabooed blood-shedding parties like the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) and the Armed Islamic Group (GIA).
On the opposite side, the National Liberation Front Party's stand, as expressed by its Politburo member and spokesman Ahmad Maamouni, is that "there is no objection to the establishment of Islamic parties, so long as they operate within the boundaries prescribed by the Constitution and the laws in force in the country."
"After the Islamic parties had been underground organizations, they went public, weathering a severe crisis that has had negative effects, such as the FIS," he said. "They are now trying to appear in a different shape that may not disagree with other parties that participate in government, such as Hams and Al Nahda.
Lahabib Adami, Secretary General of Al Nahda Movement that participates in the coalition government, said that Islamic parties were backed by strong popular support.
Suleiman Shenain, spokesman for Hams that counts among the most prominent parties in the coalition government, said, "I believe that we should be more concerned with the future of our countries in the wake of the 11 September events than we are concerned about ourselves, our parties or the currents we belong to, with regard to the pressures that are being applied to all Arab and Muslim countries. Therefore, we must think of how to weather this stage with the least possible losses and concession on vital issues. We should not confine our thinking to our level only, for national and Islamic political movements are an ingredient of this community; they are social realities that make it imperative for everybody to take them into account and deal with them as such."
Dr Ahmad Al Baghdadi, Professor of Political Sciences, Kuwait University, believes that the aftermath of the 11 September events has curbed religious movements much in Arab and Muslim countries, particularly after the activities of such movements had become suspicious, not to mention the freezing of the activities of many of the financial organizations of these movements abroad. "This chain reaction will certainly affect the future of Islamic movements, whose noise will be much lower from now on, and we will no longer hear that tone of defiance, rioting and tension that they cause in all communities," he said. Al Baghdadi also believes that all Islamic movements are guilty of financing and supporting terrorism morally and materially. "They are actually guilty, and they have to prove their innocence of this charge.
State of affairs in Lebanon: Islamic fundamentalism in Lebanon was born only recently, emerging on the Lebanese scene as a byproduct of the civil war that was fought for sectarian reasons. However, it was later tamed and brought into the fold of the State, and its elements were unified around hostility to Zionism and resistance of occupation, setting their final target as restoration of Jerusalem from the Zionists and establishment of the Palestinian state.
There are 18 sects in this country, and none of them is allowed to go against national concord, despite the different ideologies of these sects, all of which equally participate in the institutions of the country. No sect is allowed to go against the system. There is even an article in the Lebanese Constitution that stipulates the abolition of political sectarianism. However, this issue is still facing implicit rejection by a number of sects that fear the loss of the senior government positions, which they regard as acquired rights that they must keep, even if they have to fight for them."
"There is no doubt that Islamic movements in Lebanon, which total 12, follow the principles of Islam and differ with one another in some traditions, but they agree politically on the principle of fighting Zionism and supporting the Palestinian Intifada. They also unite around Hizbullah, by virtue of its possession of a military apparatus that has hurt and is feared by occupation forces. These movements see jihad for liberating Jerusalem as one of their noblest objectives.
Just a few days before the end of 2001, the Interior Minister Habib Al Adli launched a slashing attack on the Muslim Brotherhood Organization, accusing it of continuing to pursue underground operations and trying to revive its activities. The minister affirmed that Egyptian security agencies would continue to clamp down on any illegitimate activities, particularly those of groups that wrapped themselves in the cloak of religion. Mamdooh Ismail, whose request for a permit to establish the Sharia Party was rejected by the Parties Committee, making him go to court to appeal against the committee's decision, said, "The idea of existence of an Islamic party is not acceptable in official government circles.
"From the security point view, if the 11 September attacks prove to have actually been carried out by Islamists, they will indicate a serious shift in the way of thinking of some Islamic forces. Under such conditions, it would be necessary to reconsider the approach to the confrontation with the Islamists, so that this confrontation may not be escalated continuously. I believe that the solution now is that Islamic movements and potentials should be absorbed in the political arena, particularly as the issue of ruling regimes in the Third World is no longer a priority for the Western World, which is keen on fueling the strife between governments and the Islamists, even if it turns into a bloody conflict." Sultan also expressed a different opinion, saying that he expected the end of the current crisis to be followed by the Egyptian Government's adoption of a more relaxed manner in dealing with the Islamists.
WAR WENT HALF THE WAY TO BAGHDAD
The source told Al-Hayat that nothing would prevent working out a military campaign against Iraq so long as it insisted on denying international inspectors access, showing no cooperation with the UN Security Council and not abiding by its resolutions.
A Russian news agency quoted Israeli military sources as saying that the Israelis had asked the US to launch a military campaign against Iraq beginning with the western provinces. The Israelis showed willingness to put "tactics" used against the Palestinians at the US disposal, the sources added.
HSS, Al-Hayat, 3/1/2002
The dominant tension made Yemen, Djibouti, Eritrea and Kenya issue definite instructions to the pilots of civil airliners to avoid hovering over the operation field of the American forces in the African Horn area.
This system makes it imperative on the applicant to present a copy of the application for the enty visa to the security bodies in the European Union which have the right to decide to issue the entry visa or not. Moreover, the international police (Interpol) will have some role in deciding on the issuance or without holding of the entry visa.
AMERICA WANTS TO CUT MUSLIM WORLD TO ITS MEASURE
While the United States looked like a struck bull in a Spanish bullring in the few weeks that succeeded the 11 September attacks, it now looks, after having removed the Taliban and liquidated most of Al Qaeda Organization, as if it is pushed into action by two destructive motives: a feeling of being the sole power in the world, and an insatiable desire for pulling the circle of revenge wider and wider.
The first of these indications is the Palestinian file, with which the United States Administration has been dealing with the mentality of an enemy, not a mediator that seeks to achieve peace.
They have not realized yet what this land, every square foot of it, represents to Muslims and Christians alike.
The second indication is the ruthless manner in which the United States Administration has hunted down the Arab Afghans and other members of Al Qaeda Organization.
The problem here is not the propriety of the content and curricula of this education; it is this haphazard interference that American agencies want to do.
Moreover, a good part of the Holy Quran is dedicated to talk about Jews, not for establishing a racist attitude against them inasmuch as it is part of the context of the religious and historical narrative that is part of all religions and their holy books.
Suffice it to say that the graduates of religious schools have nothing to do with Islamic movements in general and radical trends in particular, as some people with limited knowledge think.
That is why the opponents of globalization were right when they recently felt that they and the opponents of the war against Afghanistan were in the same camp.
Magdi Khalil, an emigrant Coptic living in America wrote in Al Quds Al Arabi: The year 2001 has gone, leaving behind a world whose map, alliances and picture are being reshaped, particularly after President George Bush's announcement that the year 2002 would be a year of ballistic war for America.
-	I believe that Islam has lost much in the West, despite the exaggerated and artificial wave of praise that Islam has received from Western leaders.
-	Mankind may return to primitive strife, as represented by religious war.
There are many, many other results of the 11 September events. However, the most significant one is the self-evaluation stop made by the West, particularly America. The questions came one after the other: Who are we, and who are they?
Can a country live isolated from the world?
This is the scenario that is loaded with pessimism about the outbreak of a long-term conflict between the West and the Muslim world.
MFA, Al Quds Al Arabi, 2/1/2002
The three conditions set forth by Dr Usama Al Baz are: -	First: Israel must promise - and its promise must be recorded in the United Nations and the International Court of Justice - that it has no claims or intentions for expanding its borders beyond those which were actually known up to 4 June 1967.
-	Al Gomhouria also learned that there was no truth at all in the item that was printed by Haaretz about an Egyptian attempt for solving the Palestinian Cause peacefully through a phased agreement proposal that was presented to the Israeli Prime Minister.
"The recently published reports about appointing a new ambassador are divorced from reality."

FOR THE FIRST TIME, ARAB COMPANY FOR TRANSPORTING JEWS IN ISRAEL
Public transportation has so far been monopolized by two governmental companies, namely Egd, the biggest, and Dan which is operative in Tel Aviv only.

It offered to operate new buses (36 buses directly transported from the factory to service sites) it decreased prices by 23 percent and employed native workers from the locality.
MOUSA: I WON'T BE PART OF LAME ARAB LEAGUE
The Arab League Secretary General also said, "We want joint Arab action, just like others have their own joint action, so that we may not lag behind others. Joint action does not mean isolation of Arabs; it means that the Arabs have something that ties them together. The differences among European countries over some matters do not preclude the existence of the European Union."
Mousa responded to the accusations against the recent statement by Arab foreign ministers, saying, "It was not weak, and it has laid down Arab stands that had to be specified. We should not forget, however, that the statement was made after Arafat's speech in which he called for stopping suicidal operations."
INSURANCE COMPANIES ASK GOVERNMENT TO COMPENSATE THEM FOR DOLLAR LOSSES RESULTING FROM ERRONEOUS POLICIES
The former ministry was inept when it compelled insurance companies to give up their dollar balance, Mazhar added pointing out that the ministry and the government used to adopt easy, quick, partial solutions that calm down the state of the market. Consequently the government panted after the dollar rise in a bid to control it instead of setting a strategic policy for reducing the dollar exchange rate against the Egyptian pound whose reduction extended against other currencies such as the Saudi riyal which has been rising over the current period.
These circles say that there are plans to take the dollar up to what they call its real rate of exchange against the pound.
The National Bank of Egypt Board Chairman, Ahmed Dia'eddin announced that the bank, amongst the public commercial banks, had made the highest net profits this year hitting 465 million pounds.

A French delegation will arrive in Egypt to sign the contract and start the implementation..
Egypt is one of 9 countries in the COMESA that agreed to reduce the tariffs to zero, whereas the other member states in the grouping fixed various levels for such reductions.
Regardless of such costs borne by Egypt, it has not reaped the fruits of its membership in the COMESA. The statistics of the Central Agency for Mobilization and Statistics indicate a slight rise in Egyptian exports to COMESA countries. They rose from $36.01 million in 1997 to $47.62 million in 2000.
Although the Egyptian products could get access to many markets for the first time, such as rice to Kenya and electric appliances to Zimbabwe, the overcoming of the negative effects of trade swap needs some time till a genuine trade really exists between Egypt and the COMESA.
Egyptian companies have succeeded in catching a number of contracts on the Iraqi market over the past few days on the margins of the meetings of the Egyptian-Iraqi Committee, which concluded its activities in Baghdad on 31 December 2001.
In the field of railways, it was agreed to invite specialized Egyptian companies to participate in the proposed projects in Iraq for building, renovating and maintaining railroads.

On the other hand, the Egyptian Chamber of Printing Industry is done harm, now that Egypt's imports of Jordanian polypropylene and polyethylene films are on the increase in a way that threatens the national industry. In addition, the Chamber casts doubt on the Jordanian certificates of origin of such products. This was affirmed by a report compiled by the Commercial Representation Office. The total trade exchange during the period 2000-2001 hit 66.3 million dollars, the report said, pointing out that the volume of Egyptian exports to Jordan reached 42.8 million dollars and imports from Jordan hit 23.5 million dollars.
Minister of Finance, Medhat Hassanin disclosed the possibility that his ministry might backtrack on implementing the new customs tariff in case those amendments were turned down by the People's Assembly or WTO.
The minister pointed out that the new customs amendments imposed on ready-made clothes were applied as per the presidential decree which had been issued in that respect and in light of the continuation of the decision on banning importation of garments. So, the introduction of such amendments will be confined at present to the garments bought from Port Said or brought by those coming from abroad, he said.
The committee's main task concentrates on combatting all sources of customs evasion.
On January 3rd, Prime Minister Atef Ebeid held an extensive Cabinet meeting attended by Port Said Governor, Mostafa Kamel and the MPs of the governorate. During this meeting, the position of Port Said as a free zone was discussed in light of the decisions recently issued by finance minister concerning the new customs tariff imposed on 1100 fully-manufactured imported commodities.
Port Said is qualified for this strategy as it has an agricultural activity in the vicinity of 135,000 feddans, in addition to industrial and mining activities, Kamel added. Another decision, that has been agreed upon is that Port Said will be put on Egypt's map of industry through the garment factories. This will be supported through Port Said development fund. By so doing, Port Said will be an industrial city within 5 years and ended as a free zone city, he said.
On January 4th, Port Said governorate was shocked following the announcement that the city's free zone would be cancelled within five years and changed into an industrial zone.
The Chamber of Commerce in Port Said brought pressure on some of them to hang "obligatory streamers" carrying thanks to Port Said Governor and the National Democratic Party's (NDP) leaderships of the city for the efforts they exerted to reach the new amendments.

The government informed the US and Security Council of the final draft of the bill before referring it to the People's Assembly.
The government fears a parliamentary opposition to the law and a tendency on the part of opposition and majority deputies to reject the bill, which was imposed by Washington on all the Arab and Islamic countries.
The sources expected that the law would cause a considerable furore in Parliament, especially by businessmen in case the law was passed according to the American specifications.
Government disputes have cropped up over a draft law put forward by the Ministry of Finance to convert state authorities into holding companies.
He sent a letter to Prime Minister Atef Ebeid, saying that the draft bill in question will deprive the bank of concessionary international loans at an annual interest rate of one percent at most as it is a state agency acting to support agricultural and land reclamation projects.

Ghali's statements came following a visit he made to the Lebanese capital of Beirut. In his statements Ghali added that the new customs tariff which was imposed as of the year current on the ready-made clothes and other commodities aimed at protecting national industry. The customs tariff was imposed after studies had been conducted by both Ministries of Foreign Trade and Industry about how to protect national industry, he pointed out.

The Americans offered that the American forces would perform their missions secretly but with Palestinian security forces backing. He said such an operation might take a month in order to purge the Palestinian lands from such organizations.
MMS, Al-Osboa, 10/12/2001
Such statements ranged between threatening and warning.
The resolution, which gave a hope of a "comprehensive settlement" to Iraq's issue, tacitly legitimized the US demand for sending UN weapon inspectors back to Iraq, which are now raised by US officials in the form of warning to Baghdad's government.
It is difficult to rule out the likelihood of launching it ahead of this date, if relevant preparations are finalized and necessary excuses are provided.
In line with the already endorsed attitude, it is better for Iran to play a role in supporting the military operation so that Tehran may have a say in determining the Iraqi future.
Iran's important role springs from the fact that the main ground military role in this war will be performed by the Shiite opposition forces, who will march from the southern part, since the Kurdish forces, who will move from north, will be fewer in number and less armed and consistent, unless Turkey agrees to support them and play a role similar to that of Iran in one form or another.
Meanwhile, Iran is still opposing in its official rhetoric to hitting Iraq and making relevant statements for reassuring Baghdad until the date of the military operation, whether in or before next summer, comes.
THE QUANDARY OF ARAB MODERATES BEFORE THE AMERICAN PEACE LIE
Let's start with the lie!
The American mediator has imposed himself as mediator not through the force of logic, credibility or persuasion but through the force of money and arms and consequently through the weight of interests he represents and sponsors.
In other words, the peace process referentiality is how it fits in with the policies and objectives of both Israel and the USA.
Resistance of occupation has turned into terrorist operations that threaten stability in the region.
The first thing that might be noticed about such negotiations is that they lack a clear-cut goal and a fixed schedule.
It is not important either that such talks yield any results or agreements.
Due to the anti-terrorism war, the American President had, for the first time, to support setting up a Palestinian state provided that it is the end product of negotiations.
To be accurate, we have to say that the American policy in the region is based not only on lying but also on camouflage, threatening and implied intimidation.
If he declined to do so, Israel would have the right to topple, assassinate him or topple Palestinian National Authority under the pretext of self-defence, hence, Arafat's inevitable request for further time to perform that task.
If, on the other hand, the Palestinians tried to resist that violence, there they would find the charge of terrorism lying in wait.
This is exactly what the USA has been doing especially after the September 11th incidents.
M.S. Al-Hayat, 9/12/2001
It is now clear that the media campaign has several deliberate aims that the new US Administration seeks to achieve, due to its fierce desire to take revenge on Arabs and Muslims. The American Administration is exploiting the volatile state in which the world now lives as it watches the sole Superpower arrange the world and classify enemies and allies at will.
The US Administration in gambling on the younger generation of the Saud Family, who studied in American and British universities and were exposed to Western ideologies so much that they have become intoxicated and enchanted with the freedom afforded by the Western system and the Western lifestyle. It is also gambling on the opponents of the policy of the Kingdom, and the Royal Family in particular, especially the Secularists and the Shiites.
The Kingdom realized the seriousness of this media campaign from the very start and sensed that something was being cooked against it, particularly when a large number of Saudi citizens in particular were accused in the New York and Washington bombings and American security services arrested scores of Saudis on charges of "terrorism." Saudi Arabia was also alarmed by the unprecedented restrictions on Saudi applicants for US entry visas and the accusations against several Saudi charities of financing "terrorism" activities.
From the day that Arab countries allowed the destruction of Iraq and welcomed the American military presence on their territories, they have opened the gates of hell on themselves and have not been able to close them, so they are now faced with the reality that they helped so much in creating, and they have to reap the fruit of the seeds they had sown.
The Saudi refusal, which was followed by another refusal of a request that Saudi Arabia join the suspicious coalition that the US Administration calls the "coalition against terrorism" and coupled with the Kingdom's sponsoring of a donation drive on behalf of the people of Afghanistan and public criticism of the American policy, caused a severe setback to the US Administration, which was counting on large-scale support from the Gulf to cover the stupendous expenses of its military campaign that would cause more losses to the already sagging American economy.
The US Administration also needs stupendous mountains of money to fund its presence in Afghanistan. All these costs have to be taken into consideration.
The US Administration is dominated by a rightist current that has allied itself with the Zionist lobby, which harbours deep grudges against everything that stands for Islam and Muslims.
The US Administration has not stopped at that; it has demanded a full change in the Kingdom, under which the Royal Family, should it wish to continue ruling the country, must sever all ties with what the United States considers as religious extremism and terrorism, in addition to modernization of the Kingdom according to Western system, including school curricula.
MFA, Al Quds Al Arabi, 6/12/2001
Attributing the apathy in university milieus to despair and fear, he called on university students to treat the causes of that phenomenon and not avoid politics as they truly reflect the requirements of the community.
The Iranian president criticized the political apathy dominating universities in his country after the foundation of a political polarization center for political trends including reformists and conservatives.
YEMEN CONSIDERS US DEMAND FOR PARTICIPATION OF AMERICAN FORCES IN HUNTING DOWN AL-QAEDA
On the other hand, the Western diplomatic source pointed to a message Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh had received two days earlier from Colin Powell, US Secretary of State, on the bilateral relations. In his message Powell hailed anti-terrorism efforts in Yemen according to what had been announced at that time in Sanaa.
Reports pointed out that an American military delegation had spent three weeks in Nairobi, during which they contacted the Kenyan Government with a view to preparing the bases from which the American forces would hit what they called Al-Qaeda Organization in some African countries especially Somalia.
A study by the Developed Strategic Studies Foundation that has appointed itself a spokesperson for the American and Jewish pressure groups affirms that the projects of Arab nation-states have failed and that the only solution lies in redrawing maps and building new nations on a foundation of tribe, clan and family affiliations.
What America wants, or at least what it says in public that it wants, can be summarized as follows: The first priority has been, and will continue to be for a long time, to dry up the quagmires of terrorism in the Middle East, which means the elimination of all the phenomena, institutions and establishments of fundamentalist Islam and imposing strict control on its activities and organizations.
-	However, this should not prevent the United States from drying up the quagmires of terrorism, which means taking the fight to real source in the Arab world rather than Afghanistan, not for applying democracy, but to impose its necessary foundation, which Zakariya describes as "constitutional liberalism" that is based on law and order, individual rights, respect of private property, independent courts and separation of religion and the state.
From the military and political perspectives, it appears to do.
Despite the fact that adopting a tribally-based strategy may carry short-term benefits for both Israel and the United States, it will eventually prove to be a dozen powder kegs lashed together, for not only will it lead to a state of permanent in stability, but also because it may trigger a solid alliance among all the Arab parties that reject such fragmentation.
For the application of the "ruthless" capitalist system without taking into consideration the grievances and sufferings of the poor, which represent a majority among the 300 million Arabs, will be an infallible recipe for pumping water into the quagmires of terrorism.
The West will certainly expand its victory in the Cold War into the Middle East, as researcher Paul Michael Webby wants.
Foreign Minister, Ahmed Maher denied reports about Egypt's nominating a new ambassador to Israel.
The People's Assembly endorsed an agreement that authorizes cooperation with Italy in the field of counterterrorism.

The project lasts for 3 years and will organize from 8 to 12 courses annually. the sole course will take 4 days and will be comprising lectures, workshops, seminars and round tables.

The studies emphasized that the traffic problem in Egypt was the key cause of noise pollution as it was caused by the horns that cause a noise level of 150 decibels, i.e. the degree that may cause mental disorder as well as big damage to hearing and nervous systems.
The Supreme Court-Martial listened in two consecutive hearings to the main prosecution witness in the case of "Ikhwan university professors", who are accused of reviving the Muslim Brotherhood Group's activity.
Keeping sources and intelligence as top secret is the most important thing in the work of the State Security Investigation Police, he said.
The speech was alike a critique that ushered a new way of thinking and a different view that took us out of the circle of sophistry, blaming each other and interpreting history in the light of a conspiracy theory.
Fourth: Both economic growth and social change are governed by political and constitutional reform. In other words, they are governed by the reform of the system and rules of government, as the management of the country's affairs needs a comprehensive view and an integrated approach that goes beyond the boundaries of particular to the general context of the community as a whole, and perhaps even of the whole nation. Those who believe that economic progress, social cohesion and cultural prosperity could occur in the absence of political reform must be dreaming by all means, for change to the better begins in the mind, so it is the head of the nation that sets its course and steers it along that course.
Seventh: Purging the Arab community of its impurities and falsities, the deviated use of our tolerant religion and the practices that are far from true Islam requires a meticulous review. The religious establishment should play the role it is supposed to undertake but has not shouldered so far. It has to carry the responsibility it has failed to discharge so far, so as to present the true version of Islam to a world that does not understand it and to peoples to whom the noble principles of our religion are confused with things that are not related to them whatsoever.
MFA, Asharq Al Awsat, 8/1/2002
When a community loses its power of free self-expression, when it finds no parties to bear its cares nor newspapers to speak on its behalf nor elections to translate its free will, nor a government that belongs to it, when that takes place, the only way out is to search for a Ma'zoun ( a Muslim notary in charge of marrige and divorce) to perform the divorce ceremony.
THE GREATER CALAMITY!
At homes, in the streets and in public places people talk about the disasters and the impotence of the Government, market recession, soaring prices, toughness of life, the muddling on policies and expecting the worst to take place. Nevertheless, no change appears nor does the Government admit to the crisis but carries onas if everything is all right!

PERES'S VISIT TO INDIA PUTS ISRAEL ON PAKISTANI AND IRANIAN BORDERS
However, the relations between the two parties have been in progress since 1991.
Any military cooperation between those two powers will have great effects on the balances of power in the Middle East and Southeastern Asia especially if India established a foothold for the Israeli aircraft, which can strike Pakistan or Iran from behind.
According to reports run by the official newspaper "New Vision" on January 6, the ministry pointed out that the six aircraft had been actually transported to Israel last week in order to make the required modifications.
The man behind the arrangements for this deal is an Israeli businessman whose activity is currently focused on the areas under the Ugandan Army control inside the Congolese territories, the source pointed out.

The importance of that initiative lies in the fact that it comes ahead of the elections that will be witnessed by the party's institutions in this month to elect new leaderships.
" We do not seek to enjoy majority in the coming parliament. However, we disagree that our seats be minimized", said the party's General Secretary, Dr. Abdel-Latif Arabiat. "We support participation in elections, but it is the Shura Council's own decision, which is considered the highest body."
A committee of eighteen members of the National Congress Party has been formed to consider such questions and crystallize specific proposals to be presented to the ruling party's Leadership Office and Shura Council, Omar said.
Economists urged the Egyptian Government to stop the current deterioration of the Egyptian pound against the US dollar, warning against further inflation effect.
Because of this wide chasm between reality and the rosy picture that the Government has been painting for its subjects, confidence in the Government evaporates, and it becomes difficult to believe any statistics it issues, not to mention the loss in confidence in its management of the economic process as a whole."
"The Government has not done anything of substance so far, and the problem is getting more serious. The coming stage will witness a sharp decline of the country's foreign exchange revenues, and the GNP will go down even more. The Government must prepare for facing this future, otherwise it will fail," former prime minister Dr Abdel Aziz Higazi warned.
This means that we will need millions of millions of dollars to acquire technology."
Dr Lotfi affirmed that the solutions of those crises lay in the Government's adoption of actions for reducing taxes. "A new tax law should be passed as soon as possible, and the sales tax, with all its phases, should be abolished. Other burdens that impede industrial production, including customs duty and charges, should be lifted, too. Besides, the Egyptian pound should be disengaged from the US dollar and a basket of currencies, including the euro, the yen, the sterling and the dollar, should be created.
I have the answer to that: this increase came as a result of the rise of oil prices, by $ 366 million, as well as the increase in the volume of oil exports, as crude oil now represents 52% of Egypt's total exports."
A CRISIS FACING CONVERTING ECONOMIC BODIES INTO COMPANIES!
At first, the Ministry of Transport refused to repay such sums to the Ministry of Finance as that would represent financial burdens on the companies that need to be financially supported as they started to operate away from the state budget. The Ministry of Finance determination to carry on with its attitude made the Ministry of Transport demand that the state be loaded with part of such debts while putting forward the remaining part of those debts.
According to the sector of economic policies and researches at the Ministry of Foreign Trade, the performance of the export sector in Egypt is considered extremely low compared with other developing countries.
The report said that insufficient coordination between economic policies had obviously negative effect on export performance. Monetary policies have raised interest rates on loans for producers to a range of 13-15% annually. Inflation rates, in the meantime, represented 2- 3% in the late 1990's. The real interest rates, therefore, became 11-13%, thus burdening the Egyptian exporter with heavy financial loads.

MOROCCO: AL-ADL WAL-IHSAN GROUP IN MOROCCO WON'T CONTEST ELECTIONS
M.S. Al-Ahram, 15/1/2002
Signs had already appeared on the horizons that this issue could be solved by the end of last year, as President Bouteflika assigned the whole file to his Prime Minister, Ali Bin Felis, who launched a dialogue and established workshops to pave the way for announcing important decisions by the President, following a meeting with tribal heads.
The coming elections will be held on a ground that is new and different, albeit only relatively, from any other elections that were held over the past years, for these elections will be held in the absence of the tabooed Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), although some of the front's leaders have affirmed that they will play significant roles behind the scenes. They will also witness the participation of a rejuvenated Liberation Front Party, now that the party is led by the incumbent Prime Minister, Ali Bin Felis, who aspires to take his party from the minority trench to the majority seats. Meanwhile, uncertainty continues to shroud the position of the National Grouping Party, which is led by Justice Minister and former prime minister Ahmad O'Yahia and holds the majority of Parliament seats. Having come to the centre of the Algerian political scene since the mid 1990's, the Liberation Front Party continues to be one of the difficult and ambiguous forces on the Algerian stage.
These parties have their power bases in the tribal areas, although it seems that their positions will change with the developments in these areas and the anticipated presidential decrees for adopting Tamazight as an official language in Algeria.

Arab League Secretary General warned against the gravity of the situation, pointing out that we all are living the age of Palestinian liquidation and the diminution of Palestinian and Arab hopes. This is why the rightist extremist ruling Israeli establishment led by Sharon sees it timely to liquidate the principal Arab cause, which is utterly unacceptable to the Arab rulers and peoples.
This has always been the case with every country in the world.
While Moussa emphasized the importance of a return to the negotiation table, he said that peace did not mean accepting the status quo. Peace, he added, means complete withdrawal from occupied land, a principle which we adhere to. We should not be duped by the word "peace" without realizing its real meaning for peace does not mean submission!
He added that the international campaign against terrorism must be parallel to serious and sincere efforts to implement international legitimacy resolutions especially in the Middle East.

Although Muslim scholars and thinkers think that some religious education aspects need to be amended, they harbour misgivings regarding the idea of the sources draining lest it turns out to be a virtual draining of Islam itself and hence the attempt is quite objectionable both in content and form.

As soon as the CBE cuts the value of the national currency to a rate lower than the black-market one without having the ability to decisively support the rate it sets to answer the market needs, speculators fathom out this measure in a different way, imagining that moving the rate came as giving in to foreign pressure and thereupon they directly raise the US dollar rate of exchange against the pound just as happened on January 15, when the black-market US dollar selling price spiraled up to 530 piasters against the slight decline in the pound.

AL-AZHAR SCHOLARS: ALEXANDRIA MEETING IS A CRIME AGAINST AL-AZHAR AND PALESTINE
For the third time, Dr. Mohamed Sayyed Tantawi, who currently chairs Al-Azhar Sheikhdom, meets Zionist rabbis who had given religious opinions considering killing Palestinians and Arabs as religiously permissible.
They also denounced the conference conclusions and communiqué. Such rejection was not confined to television viewers who were taken aback by the conference events on the TV screen. Feelings of condemnation were also shared by those who had known of the conference before it was held or who were expected to be in charge of it by virtue of their responsibility for the committees on inter-faith dialogue, headed by Sheikh Fawzi Al-Zifzaf who failed to attend the conference even though he is chairman of the permanent committee on Al-Azhar's inter- faith dialogue.
Dr. Abdel-Sabour Shahin described the conference as a crime against the Palestinian cause, Al-Azhar and Muslims.

Surprisingly, those witnesses include Hani, son of Salah Nasser, former head of the Intelligence Department who was well known for his hostility towards the Muslim Brotherhood Group. Hani Salah Nasr, head of Opthalmology Department, Al-Matareya Hospital, will bear witness before court, in favour of his colleague, Dr. Khalid Hanafi Fahim who is a workmate in the same department.

MT / Asharq Al-Awsat, 28/1/2002
Israel has gathered all its enemies in the Middle East in one bunch, in a bid to get rid of all of them by exploiting the favourable atmosphere of worldwide elan and international tension in the wake of the 11 September events. While it has kept President Yasser Arafat under siege in Ramallah, it has been inciting the United States against Syria by confusing resistance and terrorism. Israel has deliberately pushed the Syrian- and Iranian-backed Hezbollah into the circle of probable targets of the American war against Islamic fundamentalism.
The question that persistently presents itself in the Middle East now is: Do these three countries realize the magnitude of the common threats and dangers facing them to the extent that could make them may forge ahead with integration, coordination and strategic alliance efforts?
Dr Al Ash'al believes that the same applies to Iraq and Syria, whose enmity dates back to more than two decades and is only growing more intense. "The enmity between the Baath parties of Iraq and Syria has reached the degree of grudges, with each side attacking the persons of the leader on the other side, which makes it impossible for the two leaders to clear the atmosphere between them. There are also differences at the personal and political levels between the Syrian and the Iraqis, although the two countries are ruled according to Baathist ideologies. Therefore, Syria would never agree to join an alliance that contains Iraq, and particularly Saddam Hussein. Saddam, on his part, will never forgive Syria for allying itself with Iran during the Iran-Iraq war and supplying Teheran with military and logistic requirements for close to a decade."
Israeli Jerusalem Post unveiled that Saudi Arabian threat to boycott the conference on development of Afghanistan held in Tokyo last week, in case of Israeli participation, had excluded the Israeli delegation from attending conference's activities.
The US informed Israel that it could seek an invitation from Japan, though that would be inadvisable, the sources said.
The Arab News quoted Sheikh Asharim as saying; "Bargaining on Islam and its principles is treason and extreme madness." No cultural, or educational concessions should be submitted to those who seek to exert pressure on Muslims, he added.
IRAN NOT TO DESERT SYRIA IF ATTACKED: IRAN'S DM
Shamkhani re-denied any Iranian connection with the weapon ship recently seized by Israel off the Palestinian coasts. "We are not engaged in any armament relations with Arafat or any Palestinian organizations."
The Iranian official said his country did not nab any Gulf members of Al Qaeda organization, noting that Iran's decision on an ineluctable prior entry visa to the country was made out of security considerations. Dismissing as ungrounded US reports on the infiltration of Al Qaeda and Taliban members into Iran, he said his country's borders are under full control.
"Why are such charges pressed against Iran, while the entire world turns its blind eye to Israel, which has a stockpile of weapons of mass destruction?," wondered Shamkhani.
Al-Hudaithi's meeting with the Iranian security Minister, Ali Yunis, resulted in initial agreement to be mulled over in detail later on and direct approval by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, the sources told Asharq Al-Awsat. The agreement stipulated that Baghdad prevents launching attacks by Mujahideen Khalq from Iraq while Iran compels the elements of "Filaq Badr" affiliated to the oppositionist "the Supreme Council of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq" to move away from the borderline with Iraq by a distance ranging between 5 and 10 km.
Observers attach great importance to the elections of the Shura Council of the Muslim Brotherhood Group in Jordan, due to be held early February next, now that the regional and international developments compelled the Islamic movement to reconsider some of its operation mechanisms and programs and arrange its internal conditions in a way that would cope with the post-New York and Washington attacks stage and its negative impacts on the Arab region in general.
The party official told Al-Wasat that the IAF conference resulted in a tendency to effectively participate in the parliamentary elections next summer though the final decision would be issued by the new leadership of the group.
However, what are the minimum denominators that can be agreed on by the government with the Islamic movement and the national parties particularly as the movement is at loggerheads with the government over the peace treaty with Israel and its consequences?

Moussa welcomed the receipt of those aid or the bulk of them after he felt European Union understanding of the EDBE stance, as well as other Egyptian banks positions.

Analysts say that visit, which is the ninth visit paid by President Mubarak to Peking since he took office in Egypt, shows that the Egyptian political leadership realizes China's human, economic and cultural weight at present besides its role in international policy and how to exploit this role in striking a political balance in favour of the third world countries including Egypt.

A number of chairmen of these companies recently visited Iraq among the 100- member delegation, headed by Egyptian Minister of Electricity Hassan Yunis.
MT / Al-Alam Al-Youm, 20/1/2002
The efforts exerted by the Commercial Representation Body have led to the increase in the volume of Egyptian exports to Algeria and Kazakhstan hitting 35% and 42% respectively.
The two sides have already discussed a number of issues such as Egypt's potato exports to Saudi Arabia, which have recently been facing many obstacles, as well as the three dumping cases against Saudi Arabia copper, propylene, polyester fabric imports to Egypt.
The Kingdom manufactures about 100 products, not to mention chemicals, about which Egyptian importers know nothing, the Saudi side said.
Sudanese President's peace affairs adviser, Ghazi Salah Eddin said that the Sudan People Liberation Army (SPLA) led by John Garang had rejected Egypt's participation in the International Monitoring Mechanism Committee that would be formed to supervise the cease-fire in the Nubian mountains in central Sudan.
In reply to mass media reports that America would supply the monitoring mechanism with helicopters and military equipment, the Sudanese adviser said "If the monitoring unit needed equipment for its movement and countries expressed readiness to unconditionally offer support, we would not mind, but no official offer has been made by any country and the unit has not been formed yet.
MOUSSA REPLIES TO KUWAITI ACCUSATIONS OF OVERSTEPPING HIS COMPETENCE
This came in statements Al-Khorafi made following his meeting yesterday with the First Deputy of the Kuwaiti Cabinet, Sheikh Sobah Al- Ahmed and Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Sheikh Mohamed Al- Sobah, which means that the Kuwaiti Government also adopts the same stance.
In response to a question about the reports that had it that Moussa had demanded the file be moved to the Arab League's competence and that the ideas he carried from Iraq to Kuwait were not compatible with the international legitimate resolutions, he said, "Such reports are divorced from reality and contain suppositions and fabricated matters that did not happen."
Under this headline, Mamdouh Noufal, a member of the Palestinian National Council, writes a lengthy article, with salient excerpts coming as follows: 	With the image of the Arab political system maintaining as an ill and incapacitated man, Israel and regional and international forces will be encouraged to increasingly carry on making light of the Arab nation and Ariel Sharon will find it so easy to go ahead with his scheme to subjugate the Palestinian people.
The cries of women in Gaza and the West Bank on TV screens do not only infuriate Arab citizens, but they destroy national bonds as well.
It also requires the formation of a delegation of Arab kings and presidents heading for Ramallah and then Washington, Paris and London so as to affirm to the US president and EU leaders that they strongly oppose granting Sharon the right to appoint the Palestinian people's leaders and determine the destiny of the region.
What would the leaders say to their peoples if they failed to save the Palestinian people who fell victim to a usurper that is utterly ruthless and unscrupulous and to a world order that is unjust, ruthless and biased, an order that allies itself with the devil quite blindly and insensibly!
Would they admit to their helplessness and ask their peoples to interfere for salvation?
SAAD-EDDIN IBRAHIM: I WON'T GIVE UP PUBLIC ACTION, BUT WOULD RATHER CHANGE MY TECHNIQUES
Regarding his expectations for his retrial from scratch, Ibrahim said "I expect a trial better than the previous one in which we would have more chances to prove our innocence."
The research contained a sample of 619 employees representing 51 government bodies including 331 employees for the State Administrative Authority representing 19 ministries affiliate departments and 288 local government officials.
ARAFAT'S "VISION" TRAGIC TURNING POINT
If Arafat's statements are translated into a strategy they will be a tragic turning point, that implies at the same time a historic paradox.
It is noteworthy that the opinions Arafat expressed in his article in the New York Times are binding for neither the Palestinian National Authority nor the Palestine Liberation Organization, as he is not entitled to give such a commitment that violates the national consensus.
Arafat does not have, even as an elected leader, carte blanche to present such concessions whether at the negotiating table or in a printed article in a newspaper.
Mediations carried out by Arab governments in Washington allude that a fresh compromise is in process.
EGYPTIAN EXPERT: INDIAN-ISRAELI COOPERATION TO WEAKEN ARAB AND MUSLIM WORLD
"There is a striking similarity between both Kashmirian and Palestinian issues as India and Israel have occupied territories they have no right to in spite of the big strategic importance of these territories on the Islamic level. He signaled his belief that the eruption of the Kashmirian and Palestinian Intifada came almost at the same time and that was no coincidence.
ZH/ Al-Quds Al-Arabi, 7/2/2002
The statement showed that the dangers resulting from the Israeli nuclear reactor had not been considered yet as the programme has not received any complaints or official protests from the neighbouring Arab countries, the most harmed side by such radiation.
Following his visit on top of a delegation to the Maronite Patriarch Nasrallah Sefir yesterday, Palestinian Islamic Jihad Movement representative in Lebanon, Abu-Emad announced the movement's adherence to the resistance action in Palestine. Abu-Emad stressed the importance of differentiating between resistance and terrorism.
The US National Security Affairs Advisor, Condolezza Rice said, "The deeds of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein made him a source of worry for the whole world, which has been in dispute with him for many years."
The US Administration continuously discusses with the Israelis the necessity of not humiliating and dishonoring the dignity of the Palestinian people, she said, affirming that terrorism could not serve the legitimate hopes and expectations of the Palestinian people.
The US Administration knows that Hezbollah has many roles, but it has, as she alleged, a major terrorist role.
On February 1st, a senior Russian official warned that Russia could not continue supporting Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's regime for ever if the latter maintained his hard-line way, which he described as "adamantine."
"So, it is impossible for Saddam Hussein to maintain adopting such a hard-line policy, which is almost "adamantine", he added.
Is the American danger against Iraq real, or is it not so?
The Iraqi regime and its other Arab namesakes can drown themselves to the ears in discussions of analyses and theories to build assessments on whether Washington will attack Iraq or not.
President Saddam Hussein can resign voluntarily and surrender the reins of power in Iraq to a committee comprising reps of the different groups of the Iraqi community, which would rule Iraq until the country's relations with the rest of the world are normalized and a democratic regime is established.
It has been proved that the Iraqi Army is no match for U.S. forces.
Supposing that the Iraqi ruling regime still has such weapons and so its position is not just one of sheer stubbornness but is aimed at protecting achievements, against whom will the regime use these weapons?
MFA, Asharq Al Awsat, 7/2/2002
They were held responsible for blasting the American consulate.
Hezbollah's Deputy Secretary General, Al-Sheikh Na'eem Qasem said that the American President, George W. Bush was the embodiment of Satan in a bloodthirsty leadership, adding that his evil would not be confined to our region but would extend to the whole world.
Qasem added, " Were Israel strong, America would hit through Israeli hands and keep away to promote its false pretence as the model of liberty in the world, but since Israel proved helpless, America had to intervene directly and reveal its Israeli face".
MMS Al-Hayat, 4/2/2002
The USA will also ask those countries to take similar measures on the domestic land so that American ambassadors would be entitled to ask for any additional data about such funds or investigate about certain bodies. The American security bodies will also have the right to ask to be allowed to pay sudden visits or acquire urgent data about some non-governmental organizations as well as other bodies that are domestically allowed to raise charity donations.
MMS Al-Osboa, 4/2/2002
This conflict heralds the end of the unwritten historic contract upon which the "ruling institution" in the Kingdom depends - the sword of the Family of Saud and the Wahabite Movement.
Prince Turki Al-Faysal, former chief of the Saudi Intelligence Agency, responded to Sheikh Al-Turki in an article published by Asharq Al-Awsat, a London-based Saudi daily newspaper. Depending on several rules of the Islamic Sharia, the Prince asserted that the rulers are the Family of Saud only and the men of religion are mere consultants.
Some observers believe that the Royal Family's leakage of reports that it wants the American forces to go out of the country is an attempt to mitigate the internal pressure of the men of religion.
The government wants the sermons to concentrate on secondary Islamic issues and keep away from talking about the concerns of the Muslim World and the American military presence in the country.
Several observers believe that the Royal Family in Saudi Arabia are not serious in their request to send the American forces out of the country because they are unable to defend themselves vis-à-vis the Iranian and Iraqi threats, though they had spent about $35 billion in the past ten years on purchasing American weapons.
The American authorities accuse Sheikh Usama Bin Laden of standing behind the attack that targeted the American forces in the City of Al-Khobar and led to the death of 19 Americans when a booby-trapped vehicle exploded in one of their gathering places.
Foreign Minister, Ahmed Maher said that the Palestinian cause had been an issue of national security for Egypt.
As regards President Mubarak's meeting with Israeli Defence Minister and Labour Party leader, Benjamin Bin Aliezer, Maher says it is a kind of political struggle in order to solve the crisis.
Egypt's interests and national security are connected with the Arab World, in addition to other national considerations.
Central Bank of Egypt Governor, Dr.MMahmoud Abul-Oyoon said foreign currencies especially the US dollar were available on markets. The Egyptian government paid 165 million dollars as an installment of the foreign debts due to Paris Club countries and 66 million dollars to dollar bondholders during currently January last, he added.
The rises in the dollar rate of exchange resulted in the hoarding of foreign currency with a view to making profits, which brought back the dollarisation phenomenon but at a far lesser degree than 1999. The ways of removing this phenomenon through raising the pound interest rate from 9% to 12% and 13% and decreasing the dollar interest rate are now being considered.
Meanwhile, the Egyptian production ability to be exported and open up new markets to absorb Egyptian products was limited despite the State tendency to open up some African markets.
ME/Al-Ittihad, 1/2/2002
A banking source in Alexandria Commercial and Maritime Bank told Al-Hayat that CBE's abidance by pumping dollars only in case of necessity seemed to be final this time. Banks are no longer able to bear more short financial positions so that they want now to restrict the opening of documentary credits to the cases of high necessity after they discovered that position of the CBE enjoyed wide government support that could never be changed particularly as this tendency responds to the international recommendations regarding the non-intervention in the foreign exchange market. The situation is thus likely to continue for a period of time during which banks will have to transfer direction of pressure to the beneficiaries who wasted the State reserve on luxurious importation.
Under the new system exports of yarn, textiles and ready-made apparel will be subsidized. Subsidies will also be extended to vegetables, fruit and processed foodstuffs exports. This is meant to reduce the burdens borne by such products such as the value of customs and tax duties. This is hoped to sharpen its competitive edge so that they could enter the world markets at a large scale without violating the internationally applied systems and trade criteria.
M.MS,Al-Ahram, 2/2/2001
The report said that the volume of direct foreign investment in Egypt had witnessed constant fluctuations, the preliminary figures, however, indicate tangible improvement during the year 2000. Mexico has occupied first position as far as foreign investment inflows, achieving a rate of 42.4%, followed by the U.S.A., 32%, then the European Union, 24.5 and finally the Arab countries, .6%.
The report pointed out an increase in the rate of monetary expansion growth in 2000/2001. It added that the fiscal year 99/2000 had witnessed a slowing down of monetary expansion growth rate by 8.8%. The total liquidity amounted to LE255.3 million compared to LE234.6 million in 1998/1999 whereas the year 2000/2001 witnessed a growth again as it reached 11.6%, a value of LE284.9 million.
The Paris Club members also demanded that the Egyptian government abide by all the items of the GATT agreement. The representatives of the donor countries further told the Egyptian government not to interfere in the Egyptian pound rate of exchange vis-à-vis other foreign currencies, including dollar, nor let the CBE intervene under the pretext that such policies are against the mechanisms of the open market. They stressed that the Egyptian government should promptly implement the privatization programme and launch the state-owned banks for sale, rescind decisions on nationalization which were made in the sixties against companies and exchanges, speed up passing a money- laundering law in accordance with that of the western countries.

MINISTER: TOURISM PLUMMETED BY 15% IN 2001
MHM Al-Ahram, 29/1/2002
Ebeid affirmed that balance would be struck and those who took advantage of what happened to manipulate in the Egyptian pound would be brought to book. He added that the Egyptian economy is not at all fragile. The foreign exchange reserve is still safe though it declined.
A bill will be introduced for creating a national fund for continuous training in all State institutions, he said adding that an agreement was reached with craftsmen in Egypt to qualify 200 thousand youths in return for granting each workshop 10 thousand pounds for modernisation purposes. The youth will be given loans to construct small-sized projects at an interest rate of 7% only with risk insurance in case of default. He pointed out that 400 thousand young men applied for training to be employed, but 30 thousand only attended the training course.
The serious report that has been recently conducted by the Shura Council uncovered the government responsibility for importing commodities that have local alternatives. The report pointed out that the value of commodities imported during 1999/2000 amounted to 8.7 billion pounds including 2.2 billion pounds for importing plastic, 467 million pounds for importing cast-iron pipes, 530 million pounds for importing canned legumes, 227 million pounds for importing refrigerators, 90 million for importing TV sets, and 27 million pounds for importing ceramics. The report stressed that experts estimated the lost job opportunities that could have been provided if these commodities had been bought from Egypt, at some 157 thousand jobs.
The ordinary Egyptian citizen is the one who pays the price of this haphazard importation, which has negative impacts on all the economic sectors, including the instability of exchange rate and the steady rise in the dollar exchange rate. This caused a sharp rise in the prices of most necessary commodities, which was emphasized by the prices comprehensive survey made by the Chamber of Commerce in Cairo. The survey stressed that the prices of all commodities on Egyptian markets had gone up.
The statistic pointed out that 184 companies have been privatised so far. The reason for the rise in the number of companies that are still subject to law no.203 is that the ministry separated several companies and divided them into more than one company to facilitate their sale.
The satellite companies of the Metallurgical Industries Holding Company reached 16 with overall property rights of 3.087 billion pounds and activity revenues of 3.971 billion pounds. The companies affiliated to the Chemical Industries Holding Company reached 21 in number with total property rights of 2.482 billion pounds and activity revenues of4.380 billion pounds.

W.H, Al-Alam Al-Youm, 31/1/2002
The CBE ascribed its refusal to the Banks Union's proposal to the small volume of the foreign currency remittances inside Egypt as the number of cheques of these operations didn't exceed some 400 cheques daily, which does not justify the start of that new service.
Egyptian bankers asked the Central Bank of Egypt to resume the importation of Saudi riyals from the Arab Saudi Monetary Institution especially during the seasons when demand for riyals is high. The bankers said that the rise in the riyal rate of exchange against the Egyptian pound was temporary and that things would be back to normal during the coming few days, now that the CBE had intervened and most of the travel agencies and associations needs of riyals for paying Hadj charges had been provided. Demand for the riyal relatively declined in exchange firms and was confined to the needs for paying for flight tickets after the Saudi airlines in Cairo had decided to restrict dealings to the riyal or dollar and refused to deal in the Egyptian pound.
He added that dealing with travel agencies and societies through banking transfers for paying Hadj charges denied these bodies the opportunity to speculate in the riyal rate of exchange. He admitted that the banks default on providing riyals during the past period opened the door wide to some exchange firms and currency dealers to speculate in the riyal rate of exchange particularly after Egyptian government bodies stipulated that the Hadj charges be paid in the riyal.
Al-Alam Al-Youm learnt that the great volume of liabilities that hit LE185 billion owed by the National Investment Bank (NIB) to several bodies were the first challenge faced by the bank in order to either change into a bank that works according to the banks and credit law system, or liquidate its activities.

The historic leaders of the Islamic Group concluded that, "We should all stand against such harm in the hope of Allah's reward, bounty and blesses.
M.S. Al-Hayat, 2/2/2002
Bush threatened to launch attacks on Iran, Iraq and North Korea and mentioned those countries by name.
As any country, apart from Israel, is banned from possessing such weapons, the three countries must be committing the gravest of sins?
Bush, obviously, was trying to exploit the gains made by the American forces in Afghanistan and exploit the so-called American war against terrorism. He, therefore, launched a terrorist war on the world to force it into submission to Washington's will.
Al-Hayat learnt that Arab and international efforts are being made to launch the principle, "A state for Palestine and Security for Israel" as well as an Arab support for President Yasser Arafat demand for a Palestinian state inside the 1967 borders and the recognition of Israel's right to live inside secure borders in return for a clear international support of a Palestinian state.

The Israeli Minister of Tourism, Benyamin Elon, surprised the attendees of the State Supervision Committee meeting on 4 February by proposing the development of areas within the West Bank for touristic purposes, describing tours there as "thrill tours" and suggesting that tourists go to historic sites in the West Bank in bulletproof cars and spend their nights in a hotel in Israel.
Your ideas make you unsuitable as minister of tourism, and your political views undermine tourism."
Sheikh Najih Bakirat stated that the Israeli attempt had almost caused a disaster in the Holy Al Aqsa Mosque on the evening of 4 February, when some officials of the Islamic Heritage Committee had discovered a Jewish tunnel that had been close to completion, pointing out that the tunnel's course ran under Al Rahma Gate towards the interior of Al Aqsa Mosque.
EGYPT URGES ARAFAT TO STOP VIOLENCE

HAMAS LEADER: CURRENT SITUATION MAKES IT INCUMBENT UPON ALL TO SUPPORT PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY AT THIS STAGE
Hamas does not want matters to develop into a civil war, he said, adding that Hamas wisely and deliberately considers the changes in light of which it determines its position. If matters develop to the extent that the other party wants to exterminate Hamas, the different confrontation methods must be considered, but Hamas strategic decision is the prohibition of shedding Palestinian blood. He also said that there was coordination in the popular action of Intifada through the National and Islamic Forces Committee.
Speaking about his position on women participation in martyrdom operations, he said; "Under the Islamic Sharia if an enemy usurped Muslim land, fight is obligatory to women and men. "At this stage, we see that there is no need for the Palestinian women participation in martyrdom operations. This role may be required in a later stage for it is not required that all the Palestinian people join martyrdom operations.
I am the start of Hamas and I am still alive. He who has a grain of truth should say it.
Regarding the inclusion of Hamas on the American list of terrorism, he said that that American step increased the people sympathy for Hamas. " We did not also expect America to describe us as heroes. It is natural for America to describe us as terrorists as we are enemies from its point of view", he said.
TOWARDS A FALSE TRUCE
Besides, the United States needs a "truce" on this front, so that it may be able to prepare the theatre of operations that will include Iraq and Iran, plus North Korea, although the former two have priority because of their direct link with the so-called breeding ground of terrorism.
Israel has caught the ball right, for scarcely had the American President talked about the "axis of evil," when Israel preened itself for joining the "axis of good."
Sharon will prove once again that he is the best person to guide the United States to the right path, for Israel has the plan and knows what it wants, while Washington has the power and wants what Tel Aviv wants.
Arafat also had to go the whole mile in his insinuations, so as to show those concerned that the "right to return" is no problem and can be waived.
This is Ariel Sharon's chance to dictate his conditions through the Americans, so that what will remain of the Madrid and Oslo "peace" will only be the remnants of the Palestinian Authority, with everything else being subject to negotiations from square one within a gradual context in which the payment will be in installments stretched over a very long period and will be subject to constant security checks.

JAPAN'S ECONOMIC ADVISOR TO CAIRO: JAPANESE INVESTMENTS HEADING FOR MIDDLE EAST
How would you explain this? 1st-	The balance of trade actually tilts favour of Japan by 90%. Japan's exports to Egypt has exceeded one billion dollars since 1999, while that of Egypt hits about 100 million dollars annually. This is, perhaps, because the Egyptian exports are not suitable for the Japanese market.
Q- The natural question I'd really like to put to the economic advisor is this, Why is the volume of Japanese investments in Egypt so small?
A- Surely, there is a tendency to direct Japanese investments to the Middle East. There are strong banks in the Gulf area especially in the United Arab Emirates and in Egypt in particular, but investors are always worried about the future. They might be surprised by changing the applied procedures.

This arrogant rhetoric, which constitutes a complete disdain for international law on the one hand and for Iran's talk on brotherly and Islamic relations with the Gulf countries on the other hand, is rejectable.

The meeting will be held by the governor and Al-Menya leaderships and will be devoted to discussing such matters and ways and means of coping with them in the future.

THE END OF EGYPTIAN TERRORISM
Reform party co-founder deputy, Gamal Sultan, sees that those four books and their new ideological outlook is a positive development in the march of the Islamic group, which is a basic point that is noteworthy.
The fourth book has brought about nothing new regarding the group as it is their own ideology which remained fixed regarding declaring other Muslims as heretics!
He concluded by advising a letter for letter reading of those books so that we can read between the lines and realize what happened until the books came out carrying a message to everybody to open up to the world and reject violence, extremism and feuds between members of the same society. Therefore, notes should be taken down and in-depth studies should be conducted so that a positive response would be documented rather than haphazardly improvized!
Al-Hudheibi concluded by saying, "All should unite as Mulims' position is really tough. The Jews wouldn't leave us alone. Their role now is to incite international and American public opinion against all Islamic symbols including Muslim Brotherhood, we should, therefore, deprive them of that chance and unite to face the dangers."

This caused a dearth of dollars after the demand for the dollar had increased.

St Mark Episcopate Patriarch Pope Shenouda III and Major General Mustafa Afifi, governor of South Sinai, will lay the cornerstone of a new church in Sharm Al-Sheikh. The new church, which will be built on an area of 3000 square meters, is the second church to be established in South Sinai governorate as the establishment of another church started a few months ago in South Sinai capital Al-Tur. It is to be mentioned that this church can accommodate some 3000 people.
Figures confirm that in 24 court halls in Egypt, 12 thousand women out of a total of 44 thousand defendants were tried.
Cairo claims the highest number of those women sentenced to prison as 3533 women defendants have stood before criminal courts.
Not a single woman of those was condemned to death. 16 women received hard labour sentences and only 26 received temporary prison sentences. The statistics failed to define what kind of crimes they had been convicted for even though a judicial source pointed out that, it was drug trafficking and that most of them were not Sinai women but had come originally from other governorates because local women are still adherent to the old traditions and rarely mix or deal with others.
Women, in contrast, appear in drug and unintentional murder crimes.
Murder is the main big crime committed by women perhaps because the woman is jealous by nature or perhaps because of vengeance.
Woman is also present in the world of public property cases. Defendants in such crimes are well-known outstanding women foremost among whom is Aleya Al Ayouti, former deputy of president of the Nile Bank, who is on the run in Paris after she was sentenced to 10 years in prison in the Nile Bank case on a charge of giving loans without collateral.
The reason, however, why those and more women appear before criminal courts is that women no longer are mere housewives. They have now become responsible for families. According to the latest statistics, 20 % of the Egyptian families have now women breadwinners due to the absence of husband who died, traveled or emigrated.

Western military sources laid bare that the real volume of the Turkish tank sophistication deal with Israel is 7 billion U.S. dollars, terming it as the largest in the history of Israeli military industries.

In a lengthy interview conducted by Al-Ahram with the Turkish Chief of Staff, Hussein Kefrik Oglo who was asked about the military relations between Turkey and Israel and their impacts on the neighbouring countries as well as on the Arab World in particular he said the following: The military cooperation with Israel can be summed up in the exchange of visits at a high-ranking echelon and carrying out bilateral, or tripartite, maneouvres in cooperation with the United Sates, in addition to joint military exercises, he said.
"I can say that military cooperation between Turkey and Israel aims at securing stability and bringing about just and comprehensive peace in the region. This cooperation is not directed to any other country."

Dr. Ahmed Goweili, the secretary general of the Arab Council for Economic Unity, spoke in a lecture on the progress of Arab integration organized by the Egyptian Cultural Forum to say that the defect in the integration of Arab economies and the cause of their faltering is the emphasis by the Arab countries on trade as the goal of integration neglecting the most important fact of integration; i.e. joint investments.
Moreover, the standard of living in the Arab World has deteriorated compared to the levels prevailing in the eighties. The average per capita GDP in the Arab world stands at 2500 dollars. At the same time, the levels of development in the Arab world are far below those of the international score and this degrades the Arab economic status internationally.

Minister Maher is the latest member in a series of great Egyptian foreign ministers. He is no less patriotic than any of his predecessors; he is even a separate school of Egyptian-Arab patriotism in his own right. Therefore, the "excuse but no excuse" that he found for President Mubarak means that the minister did not try to invent an excuse or explanation for his president's absence from the summit meeting.
At least, the Israeli Prime Minister's position was expected and is still understood. What was surprising and defies understanding is the Lebanese President's stand, pending explanation by Lahud. The result, however, was that the Arab League summit wedding, or funeral, took place in the absence of the bridegroom, or the dead body in the latter case.
Nothing is easier than criticism, and nothing is more popular! However, I prefer to wait until the end, so as to judge the results, not forecast them like a fortune-teller.
Perhaps Colonel Qaddafi, for instance, is the most obvious example of Arab failure. However, there are some Arab leaders who have been trying. There has also been a persistent Palestinian steadfastness that has served as a basis for every collective or limited Arab effort for finding a reasonable solution according to the principle of land for peace, and although this phrase might sound like a broken record, it remains the only basis for solution!

Each item of that initiative had been turned down by Israel before as it had stipulated impossible conditions. America, on the other hand, did not expect that a Saudi-Iraqi reconciliation would take place and that the air between Kuwait and Iraq would be cleared even relatively.

A memo was referred by banks to CBE governor, Dr. Mahmoud Aboul-Oyoon where they pointed out that the cause of the crisis should be attributed to the CBE itself as it left such credits without a cover, thus defaulting on a duty which the law had assigned to the CBE.
The Premier's decision to cover the dollar documentary credits by 100% at a time when Egypt was undergoing liquidity shortage of foreign exchange led to banks falling back on their own resources until their resources are replenished by the CBE. With the rise in exchange rates to its current level, considerable rate differentials resulted.

Some circles consider the withdrawal of the Socialist Forces Front from the elections a golden chance for the government to create new circumstances for the representatives of the moderate trend in the Oroush organizations with a view to presenting them as a "third party" in such an area where two Berber parties have been monopolizing competition since 1989, namely; the Socialist Forces Front led by Assayed Hussein Ayat Ahmed and the Grouping for Culture and Democracy led by Dr Said Sa'di who called on March 14th for boycotting elections.

I have always felt that such a Turkish absent role did not stop at that but got itself involved in a strategic relation with Israel which was reinforced by constant military cooperation.
Second: the Turkish role seems unintelligible without full knowledge of its incentives and ends.
Third: the popular growing Islamic trend failed to impose itself officially. The Al Fadhila (Virtue) Party experiment and the political denouement of Necmettin Erbakan bears evidence to a special kind of evolution indicating the trusteeship role played by the Turkish army under the name of Ataturk's secularism and how that affects the Turkish future state.
Fifth: Turkish enthusiasm for strong relations with Israel emanates from a strong desire to offer strong credentials to the USA seeking its assistance to get access to the EU membership.
The relation between the Turks and the Palestinian cause dates back to the Ottoman period since the international Zionism exercised pressure at the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century on the Ottoman Sultan at Constantinople when he was on the brink of political death to elicit from him a declaration that would bolster its presence in Palestine.
Turkey and Iraq In the recent years the Iraqi question has been the direct cause of a Turkish dialogue with the Arabs at the regional level, and with the USA at the international level.
I'd like to refer frankly to the missed out Turkish role in a political settlement of the Palestinian question.

When will Bush understand that the land of Palestine is not one of his estates and that the Arabs are not a herd of cows that can be milked under his decisions? When will he understand that Iraq is not one of his states? When will he understand what happened to Israel in Lebanon and when will he understand that the Arabs and Muslims whom he declared his enemies are the architects of his own civilisation?
Addressing Palestinian President at the end of his speech, the Arab League Secretary- General Amr Mousa said, "From the US President own house, I'd like to ask you to resist and persevere as the whole nation is behind you from the ocean to the Gulf and will set fire under the feet of the enemies.

Two days ago some of my schoolmates (females) started to think of holding a peaceful demonstration to express our feeling and give vent to our pent up anger.
The highly resounding slogans filled our hearts with enthusiasm.
KHATTAB: THE PROCEEDS OF SELLING THE PUBLIC SECTOR EQUALS EGYPT'S EXPENDITURE IN 45 DAYS
They pointed out the available potentials of the oasis especially the fact that it can cultivate crops all the year round especially vegetables and fruit due to the pure fresh underground water resources as well as harvesting its fruit and vegetables earlier than those of Europe, which gives them a competitive advantage.
Qasim approved a visit by a delegation of the Commercial Representation Body to the oasis, in addition to inviting a number of foreign embassies commercial advisors to participate in that visit in order to get acquainted with the export and investment potentialities of the oasis.
He added that that came in addition to Pharaonic tourism as it was there that Alexander the Great was coronated at Amon Temple after his conquest of Egypt, Cleopatra Bathroom, Pharaonic temples carved in the caves in juxtaposition to the other techniques used for building temples in Egypt.
He pointed out that subterranean water in the oasis came from the Nubian reservoir with its upper and lower parts. 220 thousand feddans can be cultivated by using the upper part only over one hundred years through natural techniques.
The scrambling of such capability to affect and gain recognition has, no doubt, encouraged the USA to go to those lengths of wantonly justifying and promoting the Israeli overwhelming of the Palestinian land. We talk too much about what others plan and do even though such plans and actions can be included in the list of their performance of their obligations towards their own interests or aspirations, which we, in turn, see as wickedness and ambitions.
The Arabs raised slogan has cost them the ability to deter and consequently achieve peace. On the other hand, Israel has reacted to all that with growing confidence that enabled it to exploit peace for the continuation of occupation and to gradually seek to convert that peace into full surrender.
The more Sharon wades into Palestinian blood and after he overran, besieged and starved the cities, the more popular he becomes with his people. After he cut off supplies of water, electricity and gas, after he isolated Arafat and shelled his premises, after Palestinian corpses filled the streets and their injured denied medical treatment or kidnapped from hospitals, Sharon became more popular as 3 out of four Israelis supported him, according to opinion polls.
The ugliest blemish that was unveiled was connected with the American administration as we know quite well how the USA has been biased towards Israel since its establishment in 1948. We, however, used to notice that such bias took place rather coyly. We did appreciate but with varying degrees of respect the attitudes of some American leaderships such Wilson, Roosevelt, Eisenhower and Kennedy but what is done by the current President Bush and his team simply transcended expectations whether in terms of obvious scorn for the Arabs or complete obsequiousness to the Israelis.

The MPs intending to face Finance Minister Medhat Hassanin during the debate of the draft law during the parliament sessions this week, said they aim at introducing essential amendments so that only two solutions could be available. The first solution, which is less likely, is the cancellation of such a tax on the works that have been implemented during the last five years since the introduction of the sales tax until the current fiscal year. This is meant to protect the funds of contracting companies from being exposed to bankruptcy. This is also meant to avoid the reduction of workers due to the companies shouldering such burdens while facing the danger of stagnation and recession.

INDUSTRIES FEDERATION CALLS FOR STOPPING DEALING WITH ISRAEL
He also called upon businessmen and manufacturers to take candid positions within such a context.
Italy topped the list with $309 million worth Egyptian exports between January-October 2001, followed by the USA, $293 million and Netherlands, $245 million, the report added.
It is noticeable that the ministerial committee did not announce any details about this deal, nor did it observe the transparency principle followed in such cases.

The negotiator who plays the role of a mediator between the company and the Americans is businessman Ahmed Al-Zayyat who owns the beer company.
LIST OF FOREIGN EXPORTERS TO RESTRICT UNORGANIZED IMPORTATION

NEW FACILITIES FOR NON-EGYPTIANS IN SELLING AND OWNING FLATS AND LAND
Under the amendments, the Cabinet should set the conditions and rules of the ownership in certain areas in Egypt.
They pointed out that the issuance of these pieces of legislation came in light of the rise in the real estate supply over the demand, which caused a noticeable recession in the real estate market impeding the re-investment of money invested in buildings now offered for sale. This also impacted on the flow of cash necessary for development projects whether housing or not housing ones.
This strategy will be implemented through the enhancement of private sector contributions.
The distribution of the lands to be reclaimed will be as follows: 93,500 feddans east of Assiut, east of Qosseya, west of Manfalot, west of Dairout and Assuit Valley; 44,000 feddans west of Tahta and south of Sohag; 17,000 feddans in Qena; 223,000 feddans in Nakra Valley and 947,000 feddans in Al-Kharga, Al-Dakhla and Al-Ewainat.

Besides, a Chinese delegation have also visited the oasis recently and offered to cultivate 50 thousand feddans to produce silk worm silk and castor oil in addition to making use of the oasis potentialities for curative tourism for which it is famous thanks to the Chinese tourist delegations within the framework of the agreement concluded during the recent visit paid by President Hosni Mubarak to Peking to boost Chinese tourism to Egypt.
At the beginning of the seminar Dr. Ahmed Al Gharbawi had pointed out the President's interest in to the development of the oasis and the exploitation of its resources in order to become a source of income to Egypt. Such attention has already started with a decision by Premier Dr.AAtef Ebeid to put Siwa on international tourism map.
Regarding agricultural potentials, Dr.AAl Gharbawi added that about 220 thousand feddans could be cultivated there, 20 thousand of which have already been embarked on by the Government.
He pointed out that subterranean water in the oasis came from the Nubian reservoir with its upper and lower parts. 220 thousand feddans can be cultivated by using the upper part only over one hundred years through natural techniques.
The contract, however, was renewed due to problems of credit eligibility from which some companies were suffering. This contract expired last March after the NBE used up all possible means to help those companies according to the financing conditions introduced by the EIB. The NBE, consequently, bore the commissions rate.
The US Central Command Chief General Tommy Franks, who will assume the command of any attack on Iraq, said that the USA was reinforcing its capabilities in the Gulf. American military officials uncovered that Washington had reinforced its forces stationed in Kuwait in the last few months. More land forces are expected to be sent there.
Franks denies the aim behind sending forces or equipment to the Gulf was a prelude to a military action against Iraq. "I haven't received any orders to prepare for a war." However, he affirmed that he was keen on ensuring that the US could run a war in the Gulf.
KUWAIT: "REPUBLIC OF IRAQ" INSTEAD OF "REGIME" & "HOSTAGES" NOT "POWS"
This orientation has come up during a recent meeting by a government leading figure with the local pressmen, some of whom expressed reservations about this orientation, opining that the Kuwaiti street will not accept such a "change" from the press, the sources said. They also wondered what Kuwait will get in return for this change. "This is in Kuwait favour and it's up to you", replied the government leading figure.
He added that he believed that the ball now is in the Iraqi court. In the summit Iraq pledged to do so and the pledge will be followed up by the summit to ensure that no infringements are made in that regard.
Such a tendency, nevertheless, was strongly criticized by some deputies. Deputy, Dr.WWalid Al Tabtibai in a statement to the press said: our Mouths and pens are meant to stop criticizing that impudent regime and to repress our groans even though our wounds are still bleeding from the dagger it had stabbed in our backs (the invasion).
Head of Foreign Affairs Committee in the parliament , deputy Mohamed Al Sakr, however, told mass media men that the Kuwaiti press is free and responsible and will deal with that matter according to what it deems right.
"Such discontent and other clear viewpoints have been reported to the government, he pointed out.
A high ranking official in the chamber, who asked to remain unidentified, said that Iraq's acceptance of "international conditions" as well as the rapprochement witnessed in Beirut summit between Iraq and some Gulf states would create extensive opportunities for Saudi contractors in infrastructure projects in Iraq and other constructing projects worth billions of Saudi riyals.
A member of the executive council of the Saudi Exports Development Centre told Al- Hayat that apart from Turkey his country is considered the biggest industrial country neighbouring Iraq adding that Saudi factories which had exported to Iraq through the oil-for- food-formula could treble their exports in a few months after the ban on Iraq is lifted so that they would exceed one billion dollars.
Over 30 Saudi companies and factories had participated in two exhibitions "Reconstruction of Iraq 2002" and "Iraq Project 2002" which had been mounted in Iraq between March 17th and 21st.
Saudi Minister of Education, Dr. Mohamed Al-Rashid said that education of boys and education of girls in Saudi Arabia are governed by one policy as they both emanate from Islam which the nation believes in as a creed, worship, ethics, legislation, government and as integrated system of life. This is a basic party of the general policy of the state, he added.
Milieus close to the Algerian President Abdel-Aziz Bouteflika are contacting activists in the moderate trend of the Berber Oroush (major Berber families) associations to convince them of the effectiveness of participating in the legislative elections scheduled on May 30th next.
In an interview with the Algerian official television in Al-Osboa Al-Jaza'ri (Algerian week) programme, the Socialist Forces Front Secretary General Assayed Ahmed Jedda'e said the party had decided to boycott the elections because no settlement would result from such elections.
1-	Running the elections at their set dates (next May 30th), hence, providing the best possible circumstances to convince the Berber of the necessity of participating in the elections although their participation has not exceeded 40 percent since Algeria's independence.
3-	Canceling the legislative elections, thus entering into a new transitional stage, and this is what the Socialist Forces Front as well as the former prime minister Ahmed Bin Betour are calling for.
Oroush coordination association listed a chain of denunciation activities including the staging of a sit-in in the major squares and another one near the Algerian embassy in Paris on Tuesday and sending a message to the UN Secretary General Kofi Annan.
Head of People's Assembly Committee on External Affairs and former Egyptian ambassador in Vienna, Moustafa El-Fiqi writes a lengthy article, some excerpts of which run to the following effect:
I'd like, in this context, to point out the following:
My reference here is particularly to the Turkish military establishment which, is both the advocate and votary of Ataturk's ideas.
To my mind, the real reason why Turkey is denied access to EU membership basically lies in cultural and civilizational differences.
The Turks' agenda is quite different from the Arabs' goals and aspirations.
The Ataturk oriented Turkish policy remained reserved towards the Arabs, allying itself with their enemies. Its role in the North Atlantic file represented a foreign base in the region where its military base in the region set up and its operations and attacks would be launched until the change seemed obvious in the last decade of the previous century when we found ourselves before political and military cooperation linking Ankara and the state of Israel so much so that mutual military visits became routine work that arouses both enquiries and concern.
We might not have forgotten in the last years how Turkish forces incursions inside Iraqi territories under the pretext of running after the remains of the Kurdistani Workers Party to eliminate them.
Nevertheless, we are still looking forward to a positive Turkish role, which the Arabs may welcome but is not objectionable to Israel, a role that can be just, balanced, objective and sincere.
Addressing the Arab rulers, Mousa said that the deceitful faces of Israel and its eternal ally the US were unmasked. They do not want the Arabs to live in peace, but rather surrender and sign a blank ownership deed under which the remaining Palestinian Arab land becomes Israeli property. "What will you do?" Mousa asked the Arab rulers, calling on them to provide the Intifada with weapons according to the decisions of the recent summit in Beirut.
Addressing Bush from "his own house in Cairo" (AUC) Mossa said he would like to ask the US President who unjustly and oppressively supports the Israeli enemy against the Arab and Muslim peoples, How can you understand Israel's right to defend itself but do not understand the Palestinian people's right to defend themselves and their rights, which are approved by all international laws? How can you do your utmost and use all that you have including a veto, temptation, intimidation and threatening means and even weapons to force Iraq to comply with the UN resolutions and kill more than million children and destroy the economy of a civilized nation while you stand with all your power to defend the Israeli terrorism against the unarmed Palestinian people? Which right or evenhandedness is this?
He added that it is high time for America to restore its credibility by forcing Israel to comply with the UN resolutions 194, 425, 338, and 242 without any double-standard treatment. Otherwise, America in the first place and Europe should expect evil consequences.
SUZANNE MUBARAK: HUMAN BOMBS ARE THE ONLY MEANS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE TO DEFEND THEIR LAND
The Intifada and legitimate resistance are the only weapon with the Palestinians to defend themselves, she indicated, adding that human bombs are the ultimate desperate means for those who have no other alternative.
They also called for cutting oil exports to the Zionist entity and the USA, which supports Israel in killing our people, severing all kinds of relations and forms of normalization, holding activities in support of resistance and considering Friday (April 12th) a day for wrath and protest against brutal massacres.
In a statement issued yesterday by the Federation it called upon the USA to take a just and strict stance towards the Israeli atrocities and relinquish its double-standard policy.
On April 7th, the Egyptian Bar Association staged a mass sit-in in solidarity with the Palestinian people and in protest against the Arab effeteness to protect the Palestinian people who are being exposed to heinous massacres at the hands of the Israelis.
ISRAEL RANKS FIFTH ON EGYPTIAN EXPORTS MAP
The biggest ten markets for Egyptian exports list included Spain, France and Germany. Saudi Arabia occupies the ninth position and England ranks tenth.
The American company will seek the help of an Austrian one in running Al-Amireya. Al-Zayyat offered 13 million dollars which are less than the value of the company's annual depreciation volume.
Alexandria Coptic Melli Council (Coptic Melli community) held a mass rally on April 7 evening. The rally, which was held under the auspices of Pope Shenuda III, condemned the Arab passiveness regarding Israeli massacres against the Palestinian people, and called for supporting the unarmed Palestinian people financially and morally.
In the beginning, I hardly imagined the amount or degree of enthusiasm in the hearts of my schoolmates, boys and girls alike of different ages especially after the warnings they had received from the teachers and the headmistresses, which frustrated us.
On Thursday 4/4/2002 the day we defined for the demonstration, we left the school carrying flags and chanting, "Palestine, Palestine, we're chanting in your support and won't maintain silence.
Even though no previous plan had been prepared for the march, everything was spontaneously organized- primary school students first, then the girls, and finally came secondary school boys.
EGYPTIAN SIWA OASIS SOURCE OF HEALTHY FOOD FOR EUROPE
Head of Siwa Oasis Investors Society, Dr.AAhmed AL Gharabawi presented a summary of the visits paid by the European and Chinese delegations to the forum on "Futuristic Horizons for Siwa Oasis in the Fields of Tourism, Especially Curative Tourism, Agriculture, Investment and Exports" organized by Commercial Representation Body in the Ministry of Foreign Trade for its members.
He also pointed out that the ecotourism hotel in Siwa relies on nature in all its sevices and is looked in advance for a couple of years by foreign tourists, besides the oasis safari tourism potential.
He added that if 40 million olive trees were planted on the oasis, Egypt could rank second among olive oil producing countries in the world, in addition to its high quality.
Under the above headline, the veteran writer Fahmi Heweidi wrote:
We won't exaggerate if we say that nothing of the sort has been done whether at the country or the regional level, let alone the national level. The accountability is shared out by all perhaps on a par. This is no time for speculating on or accusing the other party.
Take, for instance, a small detail that embodied that remissness, the case of peace activists who came from several countries in Europe, America and Latin America. They went to the occupied lands in solidarity with President Arafat and the camps dwellers there. They were reported by the press as having volunteered to act as human shields in the face of Israeli aggression. I have looked in vain for a name or a face of those intellectuals who had raised the flag of peace and talked verbosely about all over the country. They have often been available in posh hotels hymning the songs of peace with Israel.
The peace movements in Israeli have been exposed too. Just as the case was with each previous encounter, when such movements had to stand the real test, they simply vanished, thus finding their identity by supporting the genocide project.
Under the above headline, Salama Ahmed Salama of Al-Ahram wrote a column which ran to the following effect:
By this I'm appealing to the conscience and the mind of every Egyptian to reject the American-Israeli scheme and to start with sending a clear message to both the American and the Israeli governments through the adoption of complete boycotting of anything that is American or Israeli, let Israel come first as it is simply illogical that its Cairo Embassy will shower the Egyptian society with invitations to attend Israel's National Day while it is simply wading in Palestinian blood and officially declaring that geographical borders won't represent an obstacle to the achievement of its goals; by which we are basically meant in the first place. We have to let Israel feel, through everyone of us, that the road to such goals won't be that easy and that we reject and will abort its schemes. As for the USA, the matter becomes even more complicated even though more urgent, American interests are numerous and multifarious and there is a big illusion that many people still try to promote, they claim that we cannot live without the American aid, which is incorrect. Anybody who is close to the American aid figures and statistics in military and economic areas well know such a fact.
Al-Ahram telephoned sheik Ahmed Yassin, Hamas leader, to enquire about the various scenarios should the Israeli forces decide to enter Gaza and to ask whether that would be the virtual beginning of eliminating the Palestinian resistance.
Q: What about coordination with the other groups? Is there a unified leadership?
A: I'd like to tell "Abou Ammar" that we are with him in the battle. We're ready to sacrifice our blood for him. The people would never accept any substitute for Arafat, the steadfast struggler who refused to bend to the American demand of liquidating the Mujahideen.
Q: Arab foreign ministers have recently held an emergency meeting in Cairo and of course you know about its resolutions in support of the Palestinian right. What, then, is your evaluation of the Arab attitude?
HAMAS' SPOKESMAN: HAMAS WON'T BE SUBSTITUTE FOR PNA
Sharon has nothing to do but wave the white flag now that he has exhausted all the military cards to repress the Intifada and break the will of the Palestinian people, he added. Failure of Oslo The Israeli aggression on the Palestinian cities and people is clear evidence to the failure of Oslo peace process, as it was just a loss of time aimed at draining the power of the Palestinian people, he said. We feared that it would be only Gaza. Now, Israel puts forth the establishment of a Palestinian state in Gaza. "We heard from the Palestinian national security men who were deported by Israel the day before yesterday that the Israeli officers told them that Arafat would join them in Gaza where they could establish their state."
Not only do Palestinian athletes try to raise their country's name high in sports events but they also take part in martyrdom operations and lead Palestinian resistance men from various groups.
Q: Who was the most famous among martyrdom operation performers?
A: Until March 29th when the occupation forces overwhelmed Ramallah and other Palestinian cities, he was Jamil Al-Sabbagh, the athletics teacher who graduated from on Institute in Germany. He was granted martyrdom while fighting the Israelis in Al-Sudaneya battle on Gaza shore.
Q: What happened then?
UNDEVELOPED INTIFADA ARMAMENT "STRATEGIC BLUNDER" TO BE NECESSARILY REMEDIED: MAJ. GEN. SALAH EDDIN SELIM
This means freezing relations and oil and gas sales, denying Israeli products access to Arab countries and suspending any joint economic and agricultural cooperation programs, a step which should be implemented by Jordan, where Palestinians constitute over 50 percent of Jordan's population, and those Arab countries where Israel still has trade, media and tourist offices. It surprises you to know that the Arab-Israeli trade exchange increased by 60 million U.S. dollars in 2001, the year of the Palestinian Intifadaa real catastrophe.
The Palestinians delayed for so long in arming the resistance with anti-plane and tank shells.
However, perhaps before doing so, the Joint Defence Treaty, which was signed by the Arab League member countries in 1950 and killed by Arab passiveness and weakness, should also be considered.
Once the resistance is fully eradicated, Israel may agree to negotiate with an alternative Palestinian authority, excluding Arafat, for Sharon insists on killing or expelling the Palestinian leader, according to the scenario.
Some Moroccan companies also cancelled agreements they had signed with Israeli companies.
Heads of parliamentary teams considered the "economic boycott paper" an important step towards making Israel feel that it has transgressed the redlines by besieging President Yasser Arafat, killing innocents in the streets and preventing NGOs as well as Christian clergymen from practicing their human and ritual acts in Bethlehem.
MOSCOW PESSIMISTIC OVER MILITARY SCENARIO, CONCERNS OF UPHEAVALS & FRAGMENTATION OF IRAQ SURFACE
The Russian minister pointed out that there were concerns over armament programs, calling for their elimination with political and diplomatic methods through the implementation of United Nations resolutions.
He told the executives that the talks had made tangible progress, adding that the Russian side had been keen on facilitating procedures for exportation to Iraq.
The Iraqi Ambassador to Russia said that economic cooperation between Iraq and Russia during the past five years had amounted to $ 25 billion, which equaled one-half of the Russian budget.
Israel is now counting and classifying its losses to separate those losses brought by the Palestinian Intifada from those incurred due to other external reasons, in a bid to make up for its Intifada-caused losses through taxes and customs duties which Israel has been reluctant to give to the PNA since the outbreak of the Intifada in September 2000, the sources said.
The Israeli side ascribed the tourism sector's losses to the Palestinian Intifada. However, Israel says that other sectors were affected by some international economic developments such as the high-tech sector whose shares collapsed a couple of years ago, causing additional harm to the Israeli economy.
The 12th Conference of the Islamic Research Academy decided to allocate the Zakat of money (alms) this year for supporting the Palestinian Intifada. The conference decided to boycott the Israeli products and the countries that support it against the unarmed Palestinian people. The conference statement called for using the weapon of oil.
The defendants have nothing to do with Al-Qaeda Organization, said official sources.
AN EGYPTIAN KILLED WITH ISRAELI BULLETS WHILE INFILTRATING INTO GAZA
Checkpoints were also set up along the approaches to Rafah. According to Egyptian security sources, the Egyptian youth, 24-year old Milad Mohamed Hemeida from Al-Baheira governorate, left his governorate in the West of Delta for Egyptian Rafah and when he reached the barbed wire area at Saladdin gate, about 40 metres away from Gaza, he hurried in but the Israeli soldiers who were on the watch shot him in the chest and handed him over to the Egyptian authorities.
Grand Sheikh of Al-Azhar, Dr. Mohamed Sayyed Tantawi called upon Arab and Muslim peoples to support the Palestinian people in the face of the Zionist aggression, which he described as inhuman. He called for providing the resistance with political, economic and military assistance.
WASHINGTON PROTESTS AGAINST AL-AZHAR GRAND SHEIKH'S BRANDING JEWS AS "APES AND PIGS"
Observers expect Jewish organizations in the West and the USA to launch an attack against Sheikh Tantawi and accuse him of "anti-Semitism."
He added that the operations carried out by the Palestinians whether against the Israeli military and the occupation army soldiers or against civilians are martyrdom operations and a legitimate struggle in the cause of God. He emphasized that the Israeli society in its entirety consists of combatants as all Israelis, men and women alike are trained in killing the Palestinians and therefore cannot be deemed subject to the rules applicable to non-combatant civilians in other countries.
Dr. Tantawi disagrees with Dr. Qaradawi in an overall boycott of all American products or forbidding Muslims to buy them unless they prove extremely harmful to the Palestinians.
According to the conference sources, the controversy will escalate in the final recommendations of the conference winding up tomorrow (Thursday)
The constant reply of the Israeli embassy's staff over the phone, and in Arabic, was that the embassy will only come out of Cairo to go to Sinai.
The Egyptian-Israeli peace accord is merely a treaty for reconciliation and non-use of weapons, he added.
Visits by Egyptian businessmen and delegations, Egyptian-Israeli business deals and the activity of the Egyptian Commercial Representation Office in Israel have been suspended, he noted.
Meanwhile, sources of the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said any regional economic cooperation activity has been frozen, a move which came in compliance with the relevant resolutions of the Arab League (AL) Summit in Cairo in 1997.
The flights of Air Sinai or El-Al were only reduced in an economical way since the demand for flights by Egypt and Israel has remarkably plummeted since the explosion of the situation in the region. The normal procedures to face this poor demand is to decrease the number of flights, rather than halting them, the same source added.
It might be mentioned that the Pharmacists' Syndicate had urged pharmaceutical companies to boycott (American and Israeli goods) in solidarity with Palestinian people squaring up to the Zionist machine of war.
EGYPT: 2-BILLION-DOLLAR TOURIST PROJECTS AFFECTED BY ISRAELI INCURSIONS INTO PALESTINIAN AREAS
As of January 2001, tourism has started to register negative decrease rates. With the takeover of Sharon government and its escalated violence against the Palestinian people, the tourist sector nozedived to 8.1 percent in April 2001, which is, however, still a limited decline as the same month registered the arrival of over half a million tourists, and the January-April 2001 accumulative period registered approximately 1.8 million tourists, a more limited nosedive of 4.4 percent compared to the same period in the previous year.
-	The unfavourable impacts of the Palestinian events on Egyptian tourism can be measured by monitoring the effects of such developments on tourist influx from Israel, Palestine and the United States.
"IMPLICIT TENSION" ON BETWEEN DAMASCUS AND CAIRO, DIRECTIVES NOT TO MAKE THEM EXPLICIT

In case of the existence of good communications lines between Egypt and the Baltic countries, there will be stronger cooperation in addition to the encouragement of tourism and cooperation in many fields.
Crude, refined oil, raw cotton, leather, carbon, marble and some components of receivers and transmitters topped the list of Egyptian exports to India, said the report which added that frozen beef meat, oil seeds, grains seeds, iron and steel are the main commodities imported by Egypt from India.

He supposed a memo of understanding be signed between the Organization and its Egyptian counterpart with a view to boosting cooperation between the two countries.
China, on the other hand, started to arrange for the importation of the genetically engineered Egyptian soya beans after import measures were shortened into a month instead of 270 days in the past. This new measure took effect as of 20 March, 2002. Following his return recently from China after attending the second round of meetings of the joint agricultural working group, Dr Fawzi Na'eem, head of the Agricultural Research Centre, said Egypt's quota is expected to hit 51% of all the projects under consultation with the Chinese side.
Na'eem added that the remaining cooperation fields included in the agreement for the Chinese side include the provision of the most state-of-the-art technologies in the field of producing wheat, the sustainable development in the new areas and irrigation systems technology and guidance services.
He said, "This is untrue. Egypt has given much to the Palestinian people since 1948. The losses and devastation that Egypt has borne as a result of this conflict are more than any other Arab country has suffered."
As to the possibility of Egypt's military intervention if Israel attacked Syria or Lebanon, the Prime Minister said, "Forget about military intervention.
Knowledgeable sources said that the recent student demonstrations that tried to reach the Israeli Embassy were behind the Israeli diplomats search for another place for their embassy, now that the diplomats were totally convinced of the increasing hatred that the Egyptians felt towards them.
Party leaderships and intellectuals affirmed that the Egyptian Army was not for hire and that the strategic missions of the Armed Forces included defending all the soil of the fatherland and being ready to support sisterly Arab States if such support served Egypt's security interests without waiting for anything in return.
"There was a reasonable balance in weapons in the October 1973 War. Egypt was able to cross the Suez Canal while Syria was able to advance on the Golan Heights. That balance continued for a short time after the October War."
General Selim claims that the Ebeid government is still going very slowly about the implementation of economic reform in Egypt and the elimination of some aspects of corruption and neglect that negatively affect the attraction of Arab and foreign investments to Egypt.
"I do not agree with the Prime Minister on this point. The issue of liberating Palestine is a concern for all Arabs, not for Egypt or Palestine alone.
The Prime Minister, Dr Atef Ebeid, made some statements during an interview with the United Arab Emirates newspaper Al Ittihad and the Qatari Al Watan newspaper, including the following:
A: It is in the interest of the country not to establish political parties that have religious agendas.
Is it necessary to rule in the name of religion so that the community may have an Islamic identity?
A: But they do not rule in the name of religion.
A: It is out of the question.
People had lived together until these groups emerged.
I went through this experience when I was a young man.
A: Look at the example of people who rule under a doctrinal banner.
Q: It would also implode because of bad economic conditions.
We read the Quran and learn the values enshrined in it.
In his inquiry, the deputy said that the U.S. Congress had decided to give Israel $ 200 million to help it with its so-called anti-terror campaign. Additional funding and assistance were being arranged in light of new developments in the situation, he explained, affirming that the time had never been more appropriate than it was at present for turning down American assistance adopting an attitude of pride and depending on ourselves.
CHAIRMAN OF EGYPTIAN BUSINESSMEN'S SOCIETY: COOPERATION WITH ISRAEL IS UNLIKELY AT PRESENT
Q: How do you see the economic situation in Egypt at present, and has there been any change from last year?
Q: Are you worried about the country's economic future?
We have a state of haphazardness that has resulted in failure to manage the economy. The way to create, protect and develop a market should be reconsidered.
Is the agreement still in force?
Q: There were some calls last week for boycotting the United States and not receiving any economic delegations from there. What is your comment?
Lawyer Khalid Abu Graish, who is a member of Cairo Bar Association, said that he and his colleague had applied for Palestinian citizenship in order to send a message to the world that the four hundred million Arabs were all Palestinians who were ready to be martyred in defence of the Holy Land.
He went on, saying, "Private golf clubs have good capabilities, including courses, instructors and accommodations of the quality. All these capabilities can be exploited for promoting Egypt's image as a tourist attraction for golfers. "The establishment of this association will bring many benefits, including coordination among the different clubs with regard to the timing of tournaments and championships to avoid clashing of schedules.
The USA knows well this point, so she does not attach importance to any Arab pressure or to what can be done by the Arabs, Ashrawi said.
"Surrender" is a term not included in the Palestinian dictionary, Ashrawi made it certain.
A SPECIAL CODE FOR PALESTINE DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF ISRAEL
Under this headline, a Jordanian writer, Yasser Al-Zaatra wrote an article, some excerpts of which run to the following effect:
The losses in arms were enormous, too. The Israeli forces found 5,000 firearms including 90 machine guns, 23 workshops for making explosives and explosive belts, 430 ready explosives in addition to 20 launchers for Qassam missiles and tapping devices.
Foreign Minister, Shimon Peres says, "We know that our military operations will solve no problems".
Terrorism is just like a snake if you cut it into pieces, it would grow and continue growing.
What I want to say here is this: martyrs' blood will not be in vain as it would germinate further heroes on the same track. The same thing applies to the prisoners of war. Military losses may be made up for in the course of time. Furthermore, some operations need no elaborate preparation.
It is then a battle of unprecedented heroism, blood and sacrifices whether in Jenin or elsewhere (may be in Gaza too, in the future), which will have its effect on the momentum of the resistance and on the Palestinian consciousness. This is what matters more than anything else.
Production capacity of the three subterranean basins in the West Bank have also declined to 70 million cubic metres even though their production capacity, according to Oslo Accords provisions is no less than 170 million cubic metres. The Palestinians can not make use of the eastern basin. They are not allowed by occupation forces to build new wells in that basin that serves Jenin and Tulkarm areas.
Saudi armed forces started reinforcing their presence in Tabouk district near the Jordanian borders that separate it from Israel with a narrow strip.
The fourth armoured division and the eleventh armoured division equipped with infantry and armoured vehicles as well as the 18th division fitted with missiles have been also dispatched to Tabouk.
BEN HAGG ASKS FOR BOUTEFLIKA FOR RELEASE TO HELP PALESTINIANS

In a message to the Saudi people, of which Al Quds Al Arabi received a copy, Sheikh Abdul Hamid said, "By following this line of hers, the United States has overtly declared war on Muslims. Prior to that, it backed the Hindus against the Muslims in Kashmir, the Serbs against the Albanians, the Philippine regime against the Muslims and John Garang and his colleagues against the Muslim government of Sudan, not to mention what it has done in Afghanistan and Somalia and other places, its threats of striking the Muslim people of Iraq and Iran and its hints against Saudi Arabia itself."
Sudan has announced that it will shortly sign a military cooperation protocol with Russia for modernizing its army weapons. It accused Sudanese Popular Liberation Army (SPLA) led by Colonel John Garang of killing 30 farmers and burning 6 villages in the south.
He pointed out that Russia has the right to develop relations with Sudan which undergoes no international sanctions. He also pointed out "some common interests between the two countries". He added that Khartoum had always denounced terrorism, separation and extremism everywhere including Chechnya.
ISRAEL ASKS AMERICAN APPROVAL TO HIT 12 SITES INSIDE SYRIA
The targeted sites, some of them in Damascus, are affiliated to Hamas, Jihad, Popular Front - General Command led by Ahmed Jebril and the Popular Front for Liberation of Palestine, according to the sources. The Israeli officials informed Bush's Administration that they could bomb such Palestinian centres at one go in a chain of air raids, the sources said. The Israelis asked the Americans to support such an operation on the ground that he who shelters or backs terrorists is a terrorist too and deserves to be punished, the sources added. According to the same sources, the American Administration advised Sharon's government to avoid dealing any military strike to targets inside the Syrian territories, as such a step might be followed by a Syrian military response against Israel, something that may trigger a big regional crisis and impede the American diplomatic efforts aiming at easing the situation.
The paper interviewed Sheikh Youssef Al-Qaradawi and here are some excerpts of that interview:
We've seen how feelings, thoughts and wills reacted and how a volcano of demonstrations erupted throughout the Arab and Muslim World, which is far from insignificant.
A: They are certainly sinful.
Hasn't Iraq used the oil weapon and threatened to stop pumping it for 30 renewable day round?
It is yet, different from the September 11th incidents regardless of those who perpetrated them. Some American media men tried to identify the resistance struggle with what they called Bin Laden's jihad, but I told them that there was a big difference between the two types.
In the Friday sermon he delivered at the Holy Mosque in Mecca, Sheikh Assudeissi said that any peace initiative would be out of the question following the massacres the Zionists committed in Jenin and Nablus.
He stressed that they seek to eliminate the monotheistic state and the holy Quran. In their Friday speeches, most mosque imams and preachers lashed out at the Jews' crimes in Palestine and the U.S. support of them.
The secret consultations also touched upon the possibility of unifying the military efforts of the two Kurdish factions with a view to constituting a unified military force, said the source, expecting Iraq to be struck from the north, as an American delegation with different specialities, who earlier visited that region, inspected newly 3 developed airfields to be springboards for operations against Baghdad.

Egypt, represented by the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation, Egyptian Company for Natural Gas (GASCO) and Petroget, has a share of 50 percent in the company, he added.
NEW CUSTOMS TARIFFS THREATEN EGYPTIAN EXPORTS
The companies demand that the rules of the executive programme for setting up an Arab free trade zone be implemented. The rules provide for commitment to the enforcement of the customs tariffs and duties as well as the taxes valid in each country on 1/1/1998 and the implementation of the items of the free trade exchange agreement between Egypt and Jordan that provides for not imposing any new duties or taxes on goods or products of the two countries once the agreement becomes valid.

$194 MILLION RETREAT IN WHEAT IMPORTS
The number of European tourists dropped by 34,000, hitting 148,000 tourists.

The Interior Minister Habib Al Adli had issued warrants for arresting a number of exchange company owners under the emergency law that has been in effect in Egypt for 21 years.

In an exclusive statement to Al Ahram, the charge d'affaires affirmed that Egyptian- Japanese relations would witness a qualitative change in the coming stage, out of Japan's keenness on reinforcing those relations in all fields and its appreciation of Egypt's weight and significance as the largest country in the Middle East. He pointed out that the volume of bilateral trade between Egypt and his country last year had amounted to some $1 billion, including $250 million in Egyptian exports and $750 million in Japanese exports, adding that that figure still did not reflect the real potential of cooperation between the two countries, nor was it a proper translation of the excellent relations that bound them at both popular and official levels.
Japan has the second largest economy after that of the United States, the Japanese Charge D'Affaires said, pointing out that despite the difficulties that his country's economy had run into over the past decade, Japan still occupies first position among donor countries with over $10 billion in aid last year.
The minister hailed the support provided by the Japanese government and Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JAICA) which extended a LE150 million grant for financing the first and second stages and improving and developing irrigation in Bahr Youssef main canal area which includes five Upper Egyptian governorates.

COOPERATION WITH CROATIA FOR SETTING UP TECHNOLOGICAL CENTRES DISCUSSED
The Croatian minister welcomed partnership in these fields and emphasized that that would promote bilateral relations and upgrade their economies in light of globalization.
Dr. Ghali added that within the framework of those meetings there will be discussions regarding the signature of an agreement to support small and medium projects through cooperation between the Social Fund for Development and the Ministry of Foreign Trade on the one hand and the Ministry of Small and Vocational Projects in Croatia. Another project for guaranteeing Egyptian-Croatian exports will also be discussed so that it would be implemented under an agreement between Egyptian Exports Guarantee Company and its Croatian counterpart, besides another agreement between Alexandria Port Authority and Croatian Port with a view to benefiting by the facilities that can be obtained by Egyptian goods and trade in order to penetrate other countries neighbouring Croatia.
The Egyptian-African balance of trade deficit has climbed to $ 134.9 million against Egypt during 2001, against $ 116.5 million in 2000, as a result of the rise of Egypt's imports from the continent over its exports to African countries.
He explained that the most significant Egyptian exports to African countries included shelled rice, organic and non-organic chemical products, pharmaceuticals, metals and metal products, including aluminium, iron and steel, rubber products, paper, fuel, mineral oils, plastics resin, foodstuffs, agricultural products, including raw cotton, cars, farm tractors, tools, machinery and leather products.
Work will be started on that road using Egyptian know-how as of May 1st this year.
The company had offered its bids together with some international companies to export electric transformers as the Egyptian transformers proved to excel their foreign counterparts in terms of price and quality.
He pointed out that the volume of export contracts expected this year hit $19.6 million.
These are the main features of the project drawn up by Assistant Secretary of State Ryan Crocker in cooperation with a number of U.S. assistant secretaries of state and some Administration experts with good knowledge of the Middle East. Although the plan was viewed by some leading figures with the U.S. Administration as a work of imagination that could not be realized on the ground, Crocker and his staff assured them that the project was applicable for many reasons, the most significant of which, from the American perspective, are as follows:
-Such a solution would be agreeable to those countries that had Kurdish communities within their borders, as the relocation of Arab Palestinians to Kurdish areas would loosen the Kurds' grip over those areas.
Put like that, the project seems to be gaining acceptance in U.S. Administration circles, although there are some who oppose it on the grounds that the implementation of a plan for settling Palestinian refugees in the Arab countries where they already are at present would be easier than changing the demographic map of the region in this way. However, Crocker and his team, who have visited northern Iraq more than once to gather information to back their plan, pointed out that the relocation of Palestinian refugees in that way would provide a more comprehensive solution and serve several parties in the region.
MAHER WARNS ISRAEL AGAINST MOVING BATTLES TO EGYPTIAN BORDERS
Egyptian-Iranian negotiations are underway to set up a new project for producing cars to the value of over $ 1 hundred million, in addition to another project which has been recently signed between Iranian "Siba" and "Iran Khidhro" on the one hand and Egyptian "Jack Group" on the other for producing cars, buses and minibuses in Egypt to the value of $220 million.

$ HALF A BILLION IN LEBANESE LOSSES AS A RESULT OF THE PALESTINIAN-ISRAELI CRISIS
A Lebanese banker in London told Al-Hayat that the cause of such a retreat is the tense situation in the Middle East as well as what happened in the South front.
The Lebanese hotel sector, the tourism facilites and some supporting installations used to rely on Arab tourism and the refrainment of big groups of Arab tourists from going to Europe or the USA in light of the anti-Arab atmosphere on the heels of the September 11th incidents.
Diplomatic circles in the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs see that new seminal ideas are now being devised in the United States to prepare a fresh American scenario whose features were demonstrated in a recent meeting between U.S. President George W. Bush and Moroccan King Mohamed VI in Washington two days ago.
Seeking to encourage the Arab parties to accept the idea of the new Middle East summit, the US proposes using the Saudi peace initiative, which turned to be an Arab initiative in the recent Arab League in Beirut, as a rubric for the new conference.
Arab officials believe that the head of the Palestinian Authority, President Arafat, will shortly have to go through a difficult test of his ability to stop the martyrdom operations that Washington regards as "terrorist," now that Israel has agreed under American pressure to lift the siege on Arafat within the next few days.
The document was prepared in consultation with Jordan and Egypt, Washington's two other Arab allies, which had also participated in the formulation of the Saudi Middle East initiative that was endorsed by the latest Arab League summit held in Beirut as an Arab peace proposal, as another Arab official affirmed.
"The Arab countries that are exerting diplomatic efforts for solving the current crisis will make it plain to Arafat that the future of the political process is in his hands and that his failure would mean an end to the American commitment to the achievement of peace in the region and would dissipate the hopes for having peace in the Middle East," he added.
Bassam Abu Sherif, Political Adviser to President Yasser Arafat, wrote:
We had previously affirmed that and called on everybody to stay away from civilian targets. We had said that occupation soldiers were deployed everywhere in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and that resistance activities should only focus on the occupation soldiers and armed occupiers in the settlements that were scattered all over the confiscated Palestinian land in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
GREEK ORTHODOX PATRIARCH: AMERICAN POSITION IS BASED ON ARROGANCE OF POWER WITHOUT ANY HUMANE PERSPECTIVE
Hence, we regard that the protection of these people is a sacred duty because it is the right of everyone to live in security.
Q: But the Egyptian public opinion does not understand the American position which is colluding against the Church of Nativity.
Therefore, we should not apply our eastern perspective on the Western states. While their official religion is Christianity, they separate religion from the state. Our view of the holy places and the houses of worship - whether Muslim or Christian, whether the Aqsa Mosque or the Church of the Nativity - stems from our psychological make-up and spiritual belonging or even more than these. Hence, our response clearly differs from that of the West.
He added that he believed that it was necessary that all Egypt's decisions be motivated by keenness on the enhancement of its ability to cope with its national responsibilities and protect its economic, political and military security on her own.
MUBARAK: OUR ARMED FORCES ABLE TO SAFEGUARD EGYPTIAN NATIONAL SECURITY
STATE COUNCIL CALLS FOR EXPELLING ISRAELI CONSUL FROM ALEXANDRIA
LE30 MILLION EGYPTIAN AID FOR THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE IN 3 MONTHS
A NUMBER OF EGYPTIAN LAW PROFESSORS CALL FOR SEVERING RELATIONS WITH ISRAEL
Both Egypt and Israel have the legal right to sever these relations, Abu Al-Wafa indicated.
Dr. Ahmed Al-Rashidi, professor of international law with the Cairo University's Faculty of Economics and Political Sciences, affirmed that severing relations is legal and does not ensue international responsibility in the face of any country that takes this decision.
The PA committee on health will hold a meeting today (Saturday) to discuss the measures taken by Egypt to ensure immediate access of medical and humanitarian assistance to the Palestinians.
The deputies who had prepared a proposal reflecting the People's Assembly's wish said that Egypt would have the right to take that decision especially if it was taken into consideration that Israel had refused for 22 years (since the peace treaty was signed) to pay the compensations due to Egypt for Israel's draining its resources in Sinai during the occupation period, on the heels of the 1967 aggression.
Even though the chanting of that slogan was repeated after them by a number of students spontaneously inside the school playground, the penalty was inflicted on them, explained by a circular issued by the Education Minister's bureau and signed by First Vice Minister of Education who supervises the Minister's bureau, Dr. Hassan Husein Al-Bilawi. The circular ordered the dismissal of sabotaging students and the punishment of headmasters who caused the students expressing themselves in an uncivilized way.
Such slogans were considered by the headmistress sabotage that needed retribution.
Prior to making its rounds, the delegation will meet with the Egyptian Ambassador to the United States, Nabil Fahmi, who will brief the members on the latest developments of Egyptian-American economic and political relations and the atmosphere that has prevailed in the United States since the 11 September 2001 attacks.
Wali said that Egypt had benefited from the agricultural cooperation with Israel in devising and developing the systems used in that field.
He threatened journalists accusing his ministry of importing fruits, seeds and dates from Israel to file lawsuits against them.
"There is a previous agreement for reducing the American assistance by 5% per year as of the American 1999 budget, so that Egyptian aid will be down by 50% by 2008," he concluded.
USAMA AL-BAZ: SHARON STARTED THE DOWNFALL TRIP!
Al-Baz criticized the slogan, "Egypt first and last" which had been reiterated in certain periods to express what they called the Egyptian identity. He emphasised that it was a wrong slogan as the Egyptian interests are intertwined with those events that take place outside its own borders and are directly affected by them. Egyptian national security should, therefore, be identified comprehensively from the geographic and geopolitical perspective.
He went on to say that it might not be surprising that the Jenin Camp massacre occurred at the same date as did Deir Yassin massacre on April 9th in 1948 so that the same crime recurred but at a more heinous level even though 54 years had elapsed since the first massacre. He pointed out, however, that what happened has proven beyond doubt that the Palestinian people have not lost their steadfastness, but they currently need more Arab support not in the form of fighters, this time, but rather in the form they deem most needful.
Under the new bill, ministers would be penalized if they committed great treason crimes during their term in office i.e. any crime prejudicial to the state safety or external or internal security or the republican regime. Such crimes should be provided for in the Egyptian law, which determines the penalty required whether capital punishment, 25-year or temporary sentence with hard labour or life or temporary detention.
The announcement was made at a meeting held between an Egyptian government delegation and the Egyptian community in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) at the Egyptian Club in Dubai last week. In the meeting, a government customs service, to be provided by the Egyptian Consulate in Dubai or the embassy in Abu Dhabi, was approved. Anyone can put in an application writing the specifications of his car or equipment which he wants to inquire about its customs duty and then the consulate or embassy, on its turn, will send the application to the Customs Department in Egypt, which will have to respond immediately and in detail.
The sales tax law, which has been in force in Egypt for over ten years, faces a new crisis that may lead to its cancellation on account of unconstitutionality after the State Council, as a competent agency, had not reviewed the law before it was adopted in 1992. Sales tax proceeds exceeded the 17 billion pounds mark in the last ten years.
Meanwhile, sources close to the government laid bare that even if this law is abrogated, all applications made since its adoption will be irrevocable, especially as a Supreme Constitutional Court verdict does not envision a retroactive enforcement, but implemented since it is published in the official gazette. However, the government still affirms that the law can not be challenged.
He added that his company operates in the field of compatibility of all applications related to the management of e-business of industrial installations in diverse fields, such as financial applications, distribution, internal reports and e-commerce so that they can work through the internet and intranet. This will give different installations the chance to manage, organise and boost their benefit from all their available means of communications, he pointed out.

Al-Quds Al-Arabi learnt that the next few days would witness a Saudi, Egyptian, Jordanian action with a view to pressurizing Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to achieve two main goals; firstly, carrying out radical reforms in the Palestinian National Authority which he chaired, especially in the milieus of security organizations, secondly preventing martyrdom operations by all means.
The sources added that Maher had called for reforming the Authority and its security and political institutions and putting an end to corruption through mechanism of accountancy.
Muslim countries' Ministers of Wakfs and Islamic Affairs were divided about a unified position on the question of Palestinian suicide attacks against Israelis at the 7th Conference of Ministers of Wakfs and Islamic Affairs, which started in the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur on May 6. As Malaysia urged Palestinians to stop these attacks, other countries said that Palestinian bombers are "martyrs".
Foreign Minister, Ahmed Maher said that it is out of the question that such a conference would start from scratch. He asserted that the bases on which the peace process was set up must be honoured. Such principles are represented in Security Council resolutions 242, 338 and even the resolution 1405 as well as Madrid resolutions especially the land for peace principle.
He added, "Then it would be natural that the conference would aim at reaching a comprehensive settlement on the basis of the already agreed upon international referentialities, in addition to the achievements that had been made in Madrid and the Saudi initiative sponsored by the recent Arab summit in Beirut, thus becoming an Arab initiative."
The Egyptian Foreign Minister emphasized that Egypt would insist on this attitude as it expresses a genuine desire to reach a comprehensive and genuine peace. Any talk about excluding any individuals or states or disregarding any referentialities is entirely out of the question.
On the other hand, Ambassador Al Farnawani affirmed that Yasser Arafat's acceptance of American-British guard on the defendants in the assassination of Israeli Tourism Minister Zeevi had come as a result of strong American and Israeli pressures.
So, the Palestinians remain with no option but to persist in their resistance until the United States and Israel eventually have to recognize the Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital and give sufficient guaranties to that state.
Attending a live ammunition shooting exercise in which all elements of the Air Defence Forces were participating, Marshal Tantawi also affirmed the keenness of the Egyptian Armed Forces General Command on continuous modernization and development of the Air Defence Forces and the necessity of maintaining serious advanced training under all conditions, so that the Air Defence Forces might always be capable of defending Egyptian skies against any probable threats.
The two sides also agreed that the conference will confine itself to the agreements reached by the two sides and not lead to temporary arrangements in the end.
The sources said that Rice's statements were incomprehensible, adding that instead of giving Ariel Sharon a strong message, the U.S. National Security Adviser had prepared for his reception with a bizarre suggestion that did not serve the Middle East peace process with either its form or its content.
The Committee asked the congressmen to abide by the UN resolutions, which assert the legitimate right of the Palestinian people to resist the Israeli occupation.
The message, which was carried by the Egyptian delegation in the recent visit to Palestine, voiced Egypt's extreme concern over Palestinian divisions and differences, an Egyptian informed source said.
WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT: SHARON TALKING ABOUT MORALS!
History books do not contain a single mention, throughout the history of humanity since God created the earth and what is on it, of a case where the owners of legitimate rights surrendered to the will of evil, aggressive tyrants.
Ariel Sharon, who has followed the cruelest and lowliest of means to realize his sick and queer goals!
STATE COUNCIL TO SETTLE CASE AGAINST SHARON IN JUNE
Members of parliament said Egypt has the right to internationalize the dossier of POWs and demand bringing Israeli war criminals to trial before the International Court of Justice, and denying them access to Egypt.
The sources pointed out that during the meeting the American ambassador discussed ways and means of cooperation between some American cities and Giza governorate as the latter is considered to be one of the most important of Egypt's governorates with immense touristic and economic resources as well as promising industrial regions.
A lawyer turned on the Israeli ambassador trying to assault him but the security forces stopped him before he reached the ambassador. The incident started as the Israeli ambassador and embassy staff arrived at the tourist village in Al-Qanatar Al-Khaireya on Saturday at noon to spend the day there after the security forces emptied the place of its guests. The village's owner, Samy Hegazy, conducted the Israeli party on a Nile cruise after which the ambassador and his staff took a beans and falafel lunch upon their demand.
GIZA DEPUTIES DEMAND THAT ISRAELI EMBASSY BE REMOVED OUTSIDE THEIR GOVENORATE
Deputies said it was necessary to have futuristic outlook of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
The Egyptian authorities have arrested ten Egyptian students while trying to cross the barbed wires that separate the two cities of Rafah in Egypt and Palestine.
EBEID: MILITARY OPTION IS OUT OF QUESTION, CAMP DAVID ACCORDS WILL REMAIN
A: What I would like to affirm here is that the military option is out of the question and has been excluded by the whole nation explicitly and not implicitly, as it represents a disaster to the whole Arab nation, particularly as international law prevents any country from going beyond its borders, otherwise it will be subject to immediate sanctions.
Besides, calling for a military confrontation with Israel means a confrontation with the United States as well, and the United States is the only superpower in today's world, as admitted by the other world powers, the most significant of which are Europe, Japan and China, all of which have confirmed this fact. Therefore, despite the strong economies of these powers, which are hundreds of times stronger than the economies of the Arab countries put together, they could not venture into a military confrontation. Q: Let us move to another point.
The peace treaty has been and will continue to be upheld.
Should I lie to the Egyptian people and Arab peoples and say otherwise?
Syria appreciates our position, and so does Lebanon. Each of them is saying "I will fight my own fights," so where is the tarnishing or the negative impact?
The modern Egypt in the era of President Hosni Mubarak is the hope and promise for a continuous development in the Arab World.
Dr. Mustafa Al-Fiqi, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee at the Egyptian People's Assembly (PA), has criticized the deal under which the siege was lifted off Palestinian President Yasser Arafat in return for placing six Palestinians under American and British guard.
We should also tell them that we are ready for coexisting with Israel and mutual security arrangements, if comprehensive peace is achieved, to get rid of the Israeli complex of security. We should also tell them that we condemn the killing of innocent people from both sides," he pointed out.
However, Al-Fiqi believed that there were many reasons for hope, despite this state of pitch-black darkness. First, when there is a threat to launch a certain action, the other party will remain afraid. When the first party carries out its threat, fear will vanish and the threat will lose its force. Now the Israeli scheme has been fully disclosed and there are no such old fears of the Israeli machine of war because it was used in the most repugnant way. The second reason for hope is that the world has started to realize that Israel is a state that does not recognize human rights.
SHARON'S POLITICAL VIEW
However, this is not the view of Sharon alone; it is the view of all of Israel.
They believed that instead of being welcomed by the Palestinians, such Israeli "generosity" had tempted Arafat and the Palestinian to ask for more and heightened their ambitions, making them refuse the offer and ignite the Intifada on 28 September to pressure Israel into making more concessions.
Yasser Arafat, who refused Barak's offer with all its generosity, must go. He must be replaced by a substitute Palestinian leadership that is qualified to meet Israeli conditions.
So long as there is a will, particularly one that has come out of the ordeal stronger and more solid, the reconstruction of the installations and public utilities, even the organizations, however long it takes, is not impossible.
That is why he was carrying what he claimed to be documents indicting Arafat of terrorism and Arafat's government of corruption.
-Tempting the Palestinians by convincing them that if they choose a new leadership to substitute Arafat, the American Administration will pledge to provide the funding required for rebuilding what was destroyed and also facilitate the proclamation of the Palestinian state.
OCCUPATION & RESISTANCE
He also admitted that the resistance had received a big blow during the period from 19 March to the end of April this year and had found itself in a position of defence after losing leaders, members and some of its equipment and capabilities.
I had called brother Khalid Mash'al to ask him about the view of Islamic factions in the proposed summit or foreign ministers conference on the Middle East. He said that in his opinion, any new attempt at settlement would fail because Ariel Sharon had not altered his position, nor was he likely to change it. "The United States has moved, but not hard enough to force Ariel Sharon to change his stand.
Hamas has complained that the official Arab position has become tired just watching the resistance at work, although the resistance itself has not tired, and that this position is trying to give settlement a chance despite its knowledge that settlement will not meet the minimum demands.
EGYPTIAN-ISRAELI TRADE DECLINED IN 2001: FORMAL REPORTS
Meanwhile, economic parliamentarians expected a sharp drop of over 90 percent in trade exchange this year as a result of Egypt's decision on the cessation of all contacts and trade and economic cooperation with Israel since last April, which came in response to Israel's brutalities against the Palestinian people. The Ministry of Agriculture took the lead in freezing ties with Israel.
Egyptian businessmen should sever ties with Israel, said Chairman of the Division of Importers of the Federation of Chambers of Commerce Mostafa Zaki.

He added that that action had been welcomed by customers, particularly Arabs, who had also made their own decisions not to do business with Israel within the context of an Arab strategy for facing up to the brutal aggression of the Israeli occupation forces against the Palestinian people.
Leaders of banks operative in Egypt announced their categorical refusal to finance any operations by dealers with Israel.

The committee's report pointed out the refusal of the Egyptian electricity sector and the Egyptian Coke Company to use the coal produced by Al Maghara Coal Project is due to its poor quality, adding that it had been found that the coal produced by the project could not be marketed abroad to stop the heavy losses, as its production cost was about LE 300 a ton while it brought only $ 20 per ton on the export market.

These fears emerged in the wake of the crisis that was faced by a bill that was proposed by the Government through the majority leader in the People's Assembly for amending the second article of the Parliament Law to insure the continuity of the status of worker for government workers who are placed on retirement, so long as they continue to be members of trade unions.
A large number of deputies agreed that the Government was considering disbandment of the People's Assembly despite the assurances they had received to the contrary during the meetings of the National Democratic Party's Parliamentary Organ.

Chief editor Nabil Zaki writes the editorial on the front page to say: The plan carried by the butcher Sharon and tabled in his talks with his partner Bush is an imposition of an international sponsorship and a security mandate over the National Palestinian Authority so that a Palestinian administration will be created with Israeli- American specifications.
What is also required is the setting up of a financial system to run the finances of the Palestinian Authority. This should be a public affair to ensure that the funds do not go to finance the commando operations and to achieve transparency in the movement of funds passing through that system.
Under the slogan of "political and administrative reform and change in the organs of the Palestinian Authority" that both Sharon and Bush are raising now, a new ploy is being promoted to serve the hidden intentions of the Israeli butcher.
There are 3,000 and 2,000 Jews in Morocco and Tunisia respectively, who are mostly expected to be attracted to Israel, the paper quoted high-level sources as saying. The Jewish Agency is also preparing to attract France's Jews.

In contrast with such frequent mutual meetings, no Morocco-Spain meetings on the two countries premier level had been officially held, since 1999, even though an annual meeting between the two countries' premiers had been provided for in their bilateral treaty to deal with all the pending problems, and encourage futuristic cooperation in a particular framework.

The idea of mounting a Saudi exhibition for industries in Baghdad may be put on the back burner till next year in light of "difficulties facing mounting it during the year running due to low turn-out on the part of Saudi manufacturers to participate in the exhibition," expected Saudi industrial sources.
One of the most important reasons behind the postponement of this exhibition, which was welcomed by the Iraqi economic milieus, is the lack of sufficient number of participants as only 10 or 12 Saudi industrialists have confirmed their participation in the exhibitions, Al- Hayat learnt. Another reason is the disputes erupting over timing and prices between the companies specialized in mounting and organizing exhibitions.

The second stage of this project includes future transportation of gas to both Lebanon and Cyprus across Jordan with a view to meeting their needs of clean energy and opening new vistas of joint Arab cooperation in the fields of petroleum and natural gas.
AMERICAN TRICKS AGAINST EGYPT AT IMF
Dr. Abdul-Shakour Sha'lan, IMF's executive manager and representative of Egypt and Arab countries frustrated us when he refused to talk about anything related to Egypt and its relation with the IMF, saying that the cause behind his refusal was the instructions he had received before our meeting with him.
Tarek Youssef, assistance professor in the Faculty of Political Corps and Economy at George Town University, and who had been working with the IMF before he was sacked due to his opposition to a number of policies implemented against the Arab countries, especially Egypt, said, "Egypt had made a request to the IMF in which it declared the necessity of granting it unconditional credit facilities in order to help it to overcome the repercussions of the 11th of September incidents after Egypt was negatively affected due to the decrease of tourism and Suez Canal proceeds.
In my point of view, Egypt's problem with the IMF is due to the rate of exchange, which is a very critical problem that had endangered a number of countries in the past such as Mexico, and recently like Argentina.
Egyptian industry modernization Conference stressed the necessity of increasing the number of companies qualified for exportation, pointing out that the industry production value hit 168 billion pounds, only 6% of which are exported due to lack of quality. Chairman of Borg Al-Arab Investors Society, Eng. Mohamed Farag Amer, raised an important issue; that is Egypt has 26,000 industrial companies, only 100 of which got quality certificates.
As for opening the door before the importation of garments, he said that no ready-made clothes got access to the domestic markets.
Concentrating on exporting to Africa only will do harm to the Egyptian producer, he said.
Poverty rate in Egypt declined from 19.4% to 16.7% while the economic growth rate hit 5.6% during the period 1996-2000, said Minister of Planning Othman Mohamed Othman, who expected that the economic growth rate would annually increase 6.5% on average during the coming 5-year plan 2002-2007.
Public treasury debts to the National Social Insurance Authority (NSIA) rose up to 17.4 billion pounds on June 30, 2000, according to a NSIA report.

He said, "Arab cooperation in this field aims, in the first place, at achieving abundance in energy and Arab integration with a view to fulfilling Arab comprehensive renaissance in economic development fields and providing the required energy for all kinds of investment projects in the Arab world."
Egypt can get such soft loans provided by the WB in the coming three years at the least possible interest rate, i.e. about 2.5% and a grace period that may be extended to seven years on condition that the sum should be paid off in 17 years' time, said representative of Egypt and the Arab group in the WB board of directors, Mohamed Kamel Amr.
Egypt is expected to obtain one billion dollars from the WB and the African Development Bank by next October.
Prime Minister Atef Ebeid exerts much effort to improve the performance of the Social Fund for Development and ensure its continuation to extend loans to those who only deserve them, he added.
SHARP DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND WORLD BANK
Official sources criticized the delay in the World Bank putting those resolutions into effect, pointing out Egypt's right to get those loans and grants on par with other countries that had been granted urgent aid in the aftermath of September 11th incidents.
The disputes between the government and the World Bank over the grant and loan policies and the mysterious fate of 10 billion U.S. dollars, which were allocated to Egypt at the recent Sharm El-Sheikh Summit for Donor Countries in Egypt, have run deeper.
The government noted that the IMF commended the financial and economic reforms conducted by the government at the periodical meetings between both sides.
Following the shelving of the project for fragmenting the National Investment Bank, the World Bank renewed its advice to the Government to reconsider restructuring the local public debt, which has soared to LE203 billion ($42 billion) and seriously undermines the efficiency of distribution of the available resources among the items of expenditure and developmental investment, and even has a more serious impact on the Government's ability to carry the burdens of servicing the foreign debt.
Moreover, both the Government and the National Investment Bank will benefit from this action, as the burden of servicing this part of the debt will be lighter after the addition of interest on it stops.
By the end of this year talks would be held between the Egyptian and European sides, said the European Union (EU) ambassador in Cairo, who added that those talks would touch upon the volume of financial aid that would be added to the two years of 2005 and 2006. In an exclusive to Al-Alam Al-Youm, he declined to unveil the value of these financial sums, saying, "Egypt can get through these negotiations a good financial package from "Meda 2" program, but I can not announce these sums unless they are discussed with the Egyptian government."
The EU had banned fish imports from Egypt due to non-compliance to the health specifications agreed upon by the Union.
Dr Ghali pointed out that the importance of the French market for Egyptian exports lies in the fact that France was the third importer of Egyptian products within the European Union in terms of value of imports after Italy and Britain, adding that France was also an important market for vital unconventional Egyptian products. It might be noted that Egyptian exports to the European Union represented about 40% of Egypt's total exports over the five years.

The sources added that Sulayman had been to Ramallah in his competence as Mubarak's personal envoy.
Haarez well-known correspondent Alov Bin said that Saudi Arabia and Egypt were intensifying pressure on the Palestinian Authority to prevent "terrorism". He pointed out that head of Palestinian Protective Security Gaza Strip, Mohamed Dahlan had been invited to Cairo to meet Sulayman to discuss that issue.

In the meantime, leader of frozen Labour Party, Ibrahim Shukri calmed the worshippers down, talking to them through the mosque microphone asserting that Jihad is the way to liberate Palestine, rejecting what Tantawi referred to in his sermon as peaceful action.
After the Friday congregation,, thousands of worshippers demonstrated against Israel and the USA amid strict security measures that prevented the demonstrators from taking to the street as all streets leading to Al-Azhar mosque had been blocked.
AMERICA TEMPTS EGYPTIAN BUSINESSMEN INTO NORMALIZATION WITH ISRAEL
The report also highlighted that Egypt's joining via qualified areas exportation system would save Egyptian exports production cost in the range of 15% and 35% and would achieve a competitive edge for their prices against other products on the American market.
He added that the search work included the hotels in Al-Arish as well as the intensification of inspection measures at security barriers on the road between Al-Arish and Egyptian Rafah that is separated from Palestinian Rafah only with a barbed wire and 45-metre buffer zone.
In a press conference held yesterday, Zakzouk said, "The Holy Quran contains no such talk neither does it approve of it. It is an article of faith that Christ had no father or brothers as his mother is a virgin.
He added that Al-Azhar University had sections for the creeds in its various faculties where sects and denominations are taught by specialized professors and we've never heard that Christ had a brother or sister. It's just a lie and an attempt to distort that eternal miracle."
This might have prompted Channel 3 Chairwoman Farida al-Zomor to cancel the "Forum" Program episode on Palestine.
Asem Bakry of Mehwar Channel opened a more heated dossier by speaking about censorship on programs.
The Egyptian Parliament has discovered the disappearance of Sharia codification files that had been prepared during the period from 1979/1982 under directives from the late Egyptian president Sadat.

PEOPLE'S ASSEMBLY POSTPONES PRESENTATION OF LIST ELECTION BILLS TO NEXT SESSION
EGYPTIAN-FRENCH MISSION TO STUDY GENES OF SIWA CITIZENS
TEACHING HIEROGLYPHICS AT THE EGYPTIAN MUSEUM
MILLIONS OF POUNDS "RECEIVED" BY MPs WITH MOBILE PHONE 	"MPs are not pupils so that they should not be brought to accountability for absenteeism" is a phrase used by a member of Egypt's parliament to express anger at the "crisis" exploded by People's Assembly Speaker Fatehi Sorour when he was taken aback by getting into the chamber to find no members in.
How can the absent member bring the government to accountability? And how can he exercise his legislative and supervisory rights?
It has never happened in the assembly's history that a member was deprived of his rewards.
The travel allowance was also cut to a minimum of 300 U.S. dollars daily. Regarding the reward item, the member gets an annual reward of 15,000 pounds, not to mention attendance allowances, medical services, free railway and bus cards and other allowances, totalling over 25 million pounds, with 50,000 pounds annually for each deputy, a sum deemed by many members as "very little" compared to the member's campaign cost which exceeds millions of pounds. This makes the members reluctant to attend sessions. Hussein Megawir, the NDP majority leader, opined that there were no problems and blamed the opposition deputies for seeking to aggravate the matter and depict the members as having been familiar with absenteeism and, yet, getting allowances.
Nerin's comment on the ruling was, "The Judiciary did justice not only to me but also to an Islamic obligation - Hijab (or wearing Islamically decent clothes and head cover) especially as the law is based on Islamic Sharia.
"I have already performed a pilgrimage and worked with my husband in Saudi Arabia and feel sorry because I can't wear Hijab even though not wearing it does not constitute a condition in the contract."
The pilot concerned Nerin Salim, said, "Let me remind you that Dr Fayza Masoud, chairwoman of the Atomic Energy Authority is a physicist who wears the Hijab, a woman of whom all Egypt is proud especially as we encourage citizens, especially women who distinguish themselves in their areas of speciality.
EGYPTIAN PARLIAMENT DEMANDS THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO RATIFY U.N. DOCUMENT APPROVING HOMOSEXUALITY
The deputies threatened to refer their protest to the highest authorities to protect Egypt from that subversive document.
No one at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expected that Ann Kroger, US Commissioner at the IMF, would object to the Egyptian demand to obtain credit facilities. Kroger used the right of veto to obstruct these credits until Egypt fulfilled all the stipulated conditions related to the rate of exchange, devaluation of the Egyptian pound, repairing the balances of payments and trade, and fixing the budget deficit.
But under the pressure of several questions he started embarrassingly to answer. Abdul-Shakour said, "Egypt did not make any demands to the IMF and it did not ask for the IMF interference to execute new programmes. This means that Egypt does not need any new counsel from the IMF and all the indicators show that Egypt is moving steadily according to the economic reform programme which had been signed with the IMF at the beginning of the nineties. Egypt is also punctually abiding by foreign payment commitments." Egypt's reserves of hard currency did not plummet considerably, but Egypt would have to accelerate the execution of its privatization programme and convert all its big public projects into private ones.
This request is rejected by America which put hurdles in front of it in order not to be put into effect." "I am upset because of the tricks that are done to exert political pressure on Egypt. The tone of "misleading figures" presented by Egypt about its economy before 1998 is frequently stated.
Therefore, the IMF is putting pressure on Egypt to move its exchange rate and devalue the pound claiming that it (IMF) is going to give Egypt loan facilities.
There is no relation whatsoever between religious and human heritage and political events, a fact which would be assimilated by Israeli leaders who have violated all international and human conventions through violating religion sanctities of whether Christian or Muslim in Palestinian territories.
Because he was known for piety among the Jews and due to this medical fame, it is still a Jewish practice for Jewish patients to stay for one night in a particular room in the synagogue seeking blessings and cure!
Director of Jewish Antiquities in the Supreme Council for Antiquities Mohsin Rabi' says that there are a number of synagogues in different governorates, chief among of which is the synagogue of Iliaho Honabi, the oldest of Alexandria synagogues which dates back to 1882.
It is also religiously important for Christians and Copts as they had once observed the rites of their prayers there. It is also importants for Muslims as it was rebuilt on the Islamic model at the time of Islamic Caliphate.
However, both countries' officials were keen not to make this strain public.
Meanwhile, Syritel of Syria and Egypt's Orascom Telecom, which operate the a mobile phone network in Syria, were locked in trade problems, taking them to Syrian judiciary.
Bassam Abu Sharif, a Palestinian National Assembly member, said that the recent Sharm El-Sheikh summit did not urge the Palestinians to halt their resistance, making it certain that the summit statement was misconstrued by many Palestinian politicians.
The Palestinian member accused Israel of committing war crimes against Palestinian civilians and practising organized state terrorism against the Palestinian people.

CALL FOR KNOCKING ON KOREA'S DOOR
Q: Our first and main question is, why knock on the South Korean door in the first place?
As to Egypt, the quest for cooperation with South Korea is part of the attention paid by Egypt to attracting investments, which makes Korea very important as one of the main commercial partners of Egypt in Asia after Japan and China. Besides, there are many opportunities for launching joint investment ventures between Egypt and Korea, particularly in the field of development of advanced technology, which represents the main pillar of economic, social and scientific development in Egypt at present. Current situation:
With regard to investments, they totaled some LE 173 million on 31 October 2001. These investments are concentrated in a number of sectors, particularly industrial projects, including engineering, metal and chemical projects. South Korea comes 14th in terms of investments of Asian countries, including Arab Asian ones, in Egypt, but it comes second to Japan in terms of investments of non-Arab Asian countries. However, South Korean investments account for more than 1% of all the foreign investments in Egypt.
A: Obstacles do exist. There are negative aspects that impede the development of relations between Egypt and South Korea, including the lack of interest among Egyptian exporters in knowing the commercial opportunities on the Korean market because it is geographically remote, regardless of Korea's importance in Northeast and Southeast Asia. In addition, Egyptian industries, public and private alike, focus on importing products and technologies from Europe and the United States, in spite of the fact that South Korean products and technologies are equal to them.
The efforts in this respect should also include finding a Korean industrial base that would act as a main pillar for marketing goods in the Middle East and Africa. An agreement on protection and encouragement of investments should be concluded between Egypt and South Korea, while transparency and confidence should be established among investments and business organizations from both countries.
President Hosni Mubarak assigned the government the task of rapidly implementing economic integration projects with Libya so as to achieve the interests of the two countries and meet the ambitions of their political leaderships and back the march of Arab integrity and cooperation.
They also considered boosting the ways of joint cooperation and investments, which mount to about 3 billion dollars, canceling all the customs restraints on trade exchange movement, cooperating in the fields of gas, petrochemicals and electricity, and giving special privileges to the commodities in both countries.
The specialized technical committees started drawing up their visualization of implementing the biggest Egyptian-Libyan project in the field of petroleum and natural gas, said Minister of Petroleum Sameh Fahmi, who added that the most important project is the establishment of a company for petroleum and gas lines "tube" with joint capital of $100 million that would be equally divided between the Egyptian side - the Petroleum Corporation, PETROJET company, and GASCO - and the Libyan side.
The second line would transfer 150,000 barrels of the Libyan crude oil daily to Egyptian refineries in Alexandria and Ameriya. The production of this line would be sold on local or foreign markets, thus giving an additional value to the crude oil and increasing the revenues of the two countries.
A CONTRACT OF A RAILWAY LINE TO BE SIGNED BETWEEN TOBRUK AND AL-SALLUM NEXT MONTH
Libya was also announced to contribute to the Midor Petroleum refinery. He added that the volume of Libya's contribution to the project is being studied.
KUWAITI FUND LENDS EGYPT $400 MILLION FOR ENERGY PROJECT
EXPORTATION OF RICE TO SYRIAN HALTED
He affirmed that the Egyptian exports of rice plummeted this year to 300,000 tons against 758,000 tons last year owing to the aforementioned reasons.
Mansour who has recently visited the USA at the head of a delegation of the chamber members said that the delegation had emphasized to the American officials especially deputy President Dick Chenny the importance of American economic and trade interests in Egypt and that the continuation of the biased attitude towards Israel would bring losses upon the USA interests in the area.
The source ascribed the postponement of serious discussions on the free zone last year to the diverse issues put forward to the Congress and its congested schedule which precludes discussions.
EGYPTIAN IMPORTS FROM U.S. ON RISE, EXPORTS ON WANE
Egyptian imports from the U.S. rose up to around 573.38 million U.S. dollars from 450.321 million U.S. dollars in the reporting period, a hike of 26.56 percent. The trade balance deficit hit 454.24 million U.S. dollars last January and February, a rise of 47.1 percent last year.
This came at a symposium on the Egyptian-Indian cooperation held on 22 May evening at the Federation of Egyptian Industries.
On the other hand, head of the Indian delegation Raul Begag said the delegation noticed the Egyptian government's insistence on removing obstacles that impede development of cooperation between the two countries, pointing out that he discussed with Prime Minister Atef Ebeid means of boosting industry and how to do self-regulation through self- developingment skills.
The four agreements have been signed with Denmark, Japan, Arab Fund for Development and the Kuwaiti Fund.
However, the total costs bypassed those set in 30/6/1999 by about LE20.9 million.
The quarterly report issue by the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) on the national economy performance during the last fiscal year stated that the real growth rate of the GDP increased to 6.5% against only 6.1% in the previous fiscal year.
The CBE's net domestic assets increased by 13 billion pounds during the last fiscal year while its foreign assets volume went down by about 9.1 billion pounds, the report said, pointing out that the volume of the issued money skyrocketed by about 2.3 billion pounds during the last fiscal year so that the total hit about 37.9 billion pounds by the end of last June.
The private sector's debts due to banks hit 162 billion pounds, the report said.
The government has failed to solve dollar shortage crisis that threatens the stop of a slew of Enterprise Sector companies.
They warned against the continuation of this crisis as it threatens utter paralysis of all production lines in a lot of major companies.
Premier Atef Ebied held several ministerial meetings early last month to probe means of solving dollar squeezing problem. He pledged to provide companies and factories with their necessary needs of hard currencies before late last April.
Al-Beltagui conducted an open talk with them saying, "Egypt has recovered its touristic ability because of organized scientific planning as shown earlier by figures after September 11th events that greatly harmed tourism all over the world and caused this industry heavy losses that some countries haven't recovered yet."
As regards the rules that should be observed by the foreign banks to work in such activity, the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) set two conditions; the first is related to the authorized capital of such branches that should not be less than 160 million pounds for every branch and should have considerable dealings in the Egyptian pound.
FACILITATING ARABS POSSESSING REAL ESTATE IN EGYPT
The Ministry of Finance is currently considering three important demands regarding the removal of obstacles that face importers and their dealing with banks and government bodies. The importers' demands were contained in a memo received by Minister of Finance, Dr. Medhat Hassanein from Khalid Abu-Ismail, chairman of Chambers of Commerce Federation. They include the addition of a new article to the law of banks and credit. The new article provides that the volume of loans, documentary credits and monetary remittance should be valued in Egyptian currency on the day of the transaction at the rate of exchange which is valid at the date of application or the closing rate and should also be repaid in the Egyptian pound at its maturity date.
The importers' Division recommends replacing the paragraph by, "Should the value be in a foreign currency, it should be evaluated at the book rate of exchange posted by the CBE at the registration date and the rate of the foreign currency valid at the time of importation.
Addressing a symposium on the amalgamation and possession of banks, which was organized by the Egyptian Center for Economic Studies on May 19 evening, the CBE governor also admitted that the marginal efficiency of capital, which was set by a banking efficiency committee at a minimum of 8 percent, has been enforced by Egypt since 1992, and has remained unchangeable so far even though the committee raised it to 10 percent.
The CBE is also pondering over granting other incentives to stimulate amalgamation and possession after the government called for granting a definite tax exemption equivalent to the value of the smaller bank, Abu l-Oyoon said.

"BARQAN" WITHDRAWS FROM DEAL OF "AL-WATANY BANK" AND OFFER TO PURCHASE "MAIB"
"Barqan did not tell us about its withdrawal caused, but it has another chance to buy an Egyptian bank for the same value by which it would buy the 40% of Al-Watany Bank's shares, which are valued at about $100 million or equivalent of MAIB's shares."
CBE ASKS URGENT MEASURES FOR RESTRUCTURING NILE BANK
An official source with CBE - preferred to be kept anonymous - said that the last general assembly meeting held by the bank was in 1998, during which a 3-year budget was considered.
To make it more explicit, the resources in the new public budget amounted to 111.5 billion pounds, something that can cover only 78.7% of the total public expenses. Such estimates are remarkably less than that of the current year where it hit 83.6%, he pointed out.
The Ministry of Finance seeks to restructure the public debt and seek better financing means through reinforcing the government market of bonds and bills and counting on concessionary aid, grants and loans in foreign financing, the minister said.
The funds allocated for the social dimension hiked to 57.8 billion pounds, up 5.8 billion pounds at a rate of 41% of the budget. About 22.5 billion pounds will be allocated for education, 8.3 billion pounds for health, 6.7 billion pounds for direct subsidy and 15.4 billion pounds for insurance and pension systems, he said.
The draft budget, which will be referred by Minister of Finance Medhat Hassanin to the People's Assembly in a few hours' time, pointed out that financial allocations were earmarked for investments at a rate of 72% to reach 19.3 billion pounds, up 3 billion pounds (against the current budget) with an eye to implementing the investments required for services and utilities bodies as well as the infrastructure projects and establishment of schools, hospitals and health centres. This will be extracted from the total allocations of the new budget amounting to 141.6 billion pounds while about 6.7-billion investments will be directed to economic bodies.
Subsidy in the new budget is estimated at about 6.7 billion pounds against 6.1 billion pounds in the current one, an increase of 9%. Three million pounds of this subsidy is earmarked for subsidizing bread, sugar and cooking oil, while passenger transport subsidy amounted to 313 million pounds. In addition, 1.5 billion pounds are allocated for subsidizing the interest of public soft loans, pharmaceuticals and baby milk.
Responding to Asharq Al Awsat's comment on the situation caused by the Israeli nuclear arsenal and its impact on what he termed as tension in the Middle East, the Russian official said that reference to Israel could make the situation more tensioned at that stage.
In an unprecedented step, Syria joint Egypt and Saudi Arabia in denouncing "martyrdom operations" carried out by Palestinian uprising activists against Israeli targets.
Such a change in the Syrian attitude, nevertheless, did not come as a surprise to Arab diplomats.
Sharon's spokesman said that that text is promising and we have to wait and see how it would be translated into actions.
The first signs of the new Saudi role in the Arab-Israeli conflict started at the hands of Saudi Crown Prince Abduallah Bin Abdel-Aziz last February when New York Times affirmed that he intended to put forward a peace initiative in the Arab summit in Beirut.
What are the main features of the new Saudi role?
The bases and goals of such a partnership, nevertheless, have not been announced.
In addition to the fact that the Crown Prince enjoys real credibility on both Arab and international levels, the political weight of Saudi Arabia would allow its new role to bring about something new in the quest for a balanced peace that would preserve Arab and Palestinian rights.
Saudi Arabia, furthermore, has no geographical disputes with the Hebrew State and, therefore, its interest in direct intervention in the quest for peace process is an Arab interest seeking a peace that achieves stability in the region in the first place.
This role also comes in the aftermath of the faltering of the Egyptian role in achieving Arab and Palestinian aspirations, used to be known as the peace process.
Such reasons include the fact that the process was not actually a peace process as it was based on three undeclared but yet effective principles: continued settlement, endless negotiations and Israeli security as a priority especially the settlements security. The peace process, consequently, was not a peace one but rather a security process par excellence!
The Saudi role, backed by the Arab peace initiative, has helped to produce a sort of gap between American and Israeli priorities regarding the settlement.
SAUDI ARABIA ESTABLISHES ANTI-LAUNDERING AGENCY
Informed Kuwaiti governmental and parliamentary sources on Tuesday said the Islamic trends in Kuwait are moving in line with the Kuwaiti constitution and security and social laws. These trends do not pose any menace to internal stability, they said. The remarks were made in response to a message by a U.S. military official, expressing concern over the Islamic groups' control over the country's conditions.
Al-Bosiri went on to say, "The message is an instigation by someone providing ungrounded information."
Meanwhile, Secretary-General of the Scientific Salafi Movement Dr. Hakem al- Matiry cast doubt on the report, which came in line with the U.S. goal of squaring up to the Islamic movement in all its sectors in Kuwait and the whole world under the pretext of eradicating terror.
Directors of McDonald's and KFC fast-food restaurants branches said that their sales have retreated in the range of 45% and 65% during last January in the Omani capital of Muscat due to the goings-on in the Palestinian occupied territories and the Arab popular fury that swept the streets because of the American back-up of Israel. Meanwhile, Manfoods McDonald's-Egypt chain categorically denied yesterday the rumors had it that the American parent company of McDonald's had donated to Israel and dubbed those rumors as mere fabrications.
BAHRAIN: THE MODERATE SHIITE TREND TAKES THE LEAD IN ELECTION RESULTS
Municipality elections were also characterized by the authorities withdrawing from the political game altogether, thus neither directly nor indirectly interfering in the elections especially as its decision to ban the 10 thousand military, all Sunnis, from the vote has already retained the political balance between all participant trends in spite of Sunni objections.
He pointed out that the results had not been brought about by a real competition among the trends but was the natural consequence of the elections constituencies distribution which is considered to be unfair and ambiguous and impacted negatively on the election process.
The United States warned Arab governments and organizations against boycotting Israel, affirming that it would take firm actions for foiling that boycott and declare an American counter boycott in response to Arab boycott of the Zionist entity.
A recent formal opinion poll on the performance of Abdel-Kader Bagamal government showed that the respondents, who were chosen from Sanaa, Aden, Ta'izz Al- Hudaydah and Hadramawt, are mostly discontented with the government's performance, saying that it made no tangible achievement at the level of simple citizens' living standards.
Over 66 percent denied any favourable shifts in Bagamal government in any field, while others hoped that the government would take anti-corruption decisions, strictly implement decrees, reduce basic service prices, raise salaries, resolve unemployment and finally open the door of Jihad to support the Palestinian people.
Thus, he initiated a political tradition that would be a good point for him if he retained his post in the coming governments.
This step came at a time when 470 civilians in south Sudan were reported killed last week at the hands of Ugandan opponents.
Bashir pointed out that such relations would never be against any other country, in an allusion to the Eritrean fear of Khartoum-Addis Ababa's rapprochement.
Furthermore, the pro-Iraq partisan statements that defended Iraq and talked about the sufferings of its people have obviously lost much vigour without the government having in reality a basic role in such lukewarmness. Those concerned in the Iraqi issue from the Jordanian perspective point out that over 30 popular and partisan committees formed in Amman and other Jordanian governorates in support of the Iraqi people are now entirely absent from the scene. In the last 6 weeks, no significant statements have been issued neither were any activities organized on the Jordanian arena on the Iraqi file. The talk in the partisan street about solidarity with the Iraqis reached its lowest ebb, which signifies a phenomenon that is worth analysis and exploration.
Heated debate dominated the activities of the symposium on the "Euro-Mediterranean partnership Cultural Multiplicity and Universality of Human Rights", which was organized two days ago in Rabat. This was due to recommendations put forward by Tamazight (Berber) organizations belonging to Morocco and Algeria calling for changing the name of the "Arab Maghreb" area into "North Africa" on the grounds that the latter is "a geographical nomination that does not imply any ideological aspects."
On May 9, Minister of the Interior, Yazid Zarhouni, stressed that the authority "will resort to the use of all available means to impose the respect of law and give citizens easy access to casting a ballot away of any disturbances."
Chairman of Labour Party, Lewiza Hanoun, headed for Aen Al-Dafla city (120 km to the west). In addition, Chairman of the National Democratic Grouping, Ahmed Ou-Yehia, went to Bordg Bo'rierig city (200 km to the east), while the secretary general of the Liberation Front, Prime Minister Ali Bin Flis preferred Warqala city, 800 km to the south of the capital.
These two parties have boycotted the elections in protest against the situation in Qabaliya area which is considered their main electoral stronghold.
His uniqueness is most apparent due to his success in founding the "Reform" movement and became the only person who was licensed to form a political party following his withdrawal as one of the six rivals of the current President!
Q: On what basis do you build your expectations which I'm afraid might be beyond reasonable ambitions.
A: In principle, I'd like to assure you that our party lists are open to all the people's sons, provided they meet our conditions in our candidates whom we will present to the nation!
I have already said that in case of free transparent and fair elections, which condition I'd like you to highlight and underline as we're aware of the regime here.
What do you think? A: We're betting on the inevitability of facing up to rigging as it has become a crime in the nation's eye.
Q: What do you think of the pledge by majority leader and minister of justice, Ahmed Oyehia that he would forestall and intercept the Islamic trend in the elections?
Then we decided that if we could not complete the procedures on schedule, things would take another turn.
Q: The clear image of the world after the September 11th incidents has not crystallized yet.
Those incidents, nevertheless, have given Washington the green light to implement its schemes by imposing the so-called new world order based on secularization and westernization.
If we assert that we see nothing new in the developments following the September 11th incidents, our argument is supported by the fact that American policies in the Islamic world in general and the Arab world in particular just forge ahead with serving Zionism and its project.
We're sure that the masses have confidence in the Islamic trend as they discovered that it genuinely expresses their rights and freedoms. Those masses also want to know from practical experience the potential of the Islamic project in government and they're entitled to do so.
Q: I mean his vision of change and his promotion of the idea of an Islamic government in Afghanistan in the way we have seen.
Had they been more broad-minded and carefully studied various Islamic sects, they would have spared themselves the embarrassment they brought upon themselves together with the nation's scholars.
Yassin's statements synchronized with recently reported rumours about his sickness and differences among his group's leaderships flaring up.
Earlier, officials at Al-Adl Wal Ehsan announced that the group would not participate in the elections, as it does not trust the fairness and transparency of such elections. The forthcoming elections will be just the same as the elections held in Morocco since the 1960s where rigging, interference of authorities and using money to buy votes are witnessed, the officials said.
At last, the Moroccan parliament has unanimously succeeded in passing its organizational law (the new election act), which came as a result of common consent of all Moroccan parties represented in the parliament after tours of negotiation made by the Moroccan Minister of the Interior Idris Jatto in light of objections raised by the opposition inside the parliament's interior affairs committee. Some of those objections escalated to the extent that some opposition parties threatened to boycott the forthcoming elections scheduled to be conducted next September if their amendments to the draft law on elections were disregarded. The same stand was supported by some majority parties participating in the government (the Democratic Gathering of Liberals and the Popular National Movement) and even some deputies belonging to other majority parties.
The aforementioned point represents the outstanding bet in the forthcoming elections, as the endorsed "biggest number" system provides for giving the remaining seats, which neither party could win the decisive percentage to occupy, to the party that wins the largest number of votes in its constituency. However, the "highest rate" system provides for leaving such seats for the party that wins the largest rate, rather than number, of votes.
Forming a committee to consider the issue of public finance of election campaigns including representatives of different departments and concerned parties. Founding regional committees to follow up the elections according to new a formula to be set later.

This classification includes ministries' department heads that work outside their ministries' buildings, public institutions' heads and directors of the shareholding companies to which the state contributes over than 30 percent.
Waiting for the rest of details concerning constituencies and election provisions, Morocco is getting through its battle to win the bet over the first fair, unchallenged elections now that its opponents had given consent to the election law after painful turmoil. No one could predict to what extent such conformity could persist.
While the volume of incoming investments hiked, the rate of such investments in comparison to the total foreign direct investments flowing into world countries is still unchanged. Direct foreign investments all over the world went up from 4.1% to 16.3% during the period 1989-1999. In the developing countries this rate increased from 5.2% to 13.8%, according to the study.
The report uncovered unfair of distributing direct foreign investments either at the countries and geographical level or at the industries level, as over than 30 countries that host foreign investments monopolized 95% of the international direct investments and 90% of the accumulated foreign capital. Most direct foreign capital headed for electric and electronic equipment, oil discoveries and distribution industries. Service sector gained more importance in the international production during the last ten years due to the liberalization of this sector and the removal of restrictions imposed on the inflow of direct foreign investments.

The source added that the Ministry of Housing was intent on making inventory of the housing units owned by such companies, Housing and Development Bank and the Cooperatives Authority in such areas as well as devising gradual schedules for the interest rate according to the area of each housing unit.
Prices also increased and that also led to a sharp decline in power of purchase. Borrowing The housing problem escalated once most of the banks stopped lending the new housing projects after they used to grant finance to real estate investments,. This led to a cash shortage crisis synchronized with a decrease in demand for the offered projects.
Experts wonder: Does the Government seek to give the chance to the investors of such a sector to achieve adequate revenues and, on the other hand, give the banks the chance to restore their funds borrowed by those investors, thus putting into effect the real estate mortgage law?
Defaulting together with the disproportion between the supply and the available demand for such units led the banks and the investment companies that are concerned with the real estate investment to rotate in the circle of rescheduling, recession and default. Some of them decided to be liquidated.
He added that the Advisory Council for Industry had tasked the relevant body at the Modernization Centre to introduce the amendments and offer the new plan in a fortnight to be discussed in a meeting by the Advisory Council, as a prelude to having them approved by Industry Modernization Council.

Moreover, the draft law gives the Capital Market Authority the right to file collective lawsuits at courts on behalf of all shareholders and companies harmed due to any body or person violating the provisions of Capital Market Act and Central Depositing and Registration Act.
The situation is still under study by the authority. Moreover, financial institutions and individuals who hold about 20% refuse to sell their shares through this offer due to lack of declaration and transparency concerning the developments taking place in the company.
NEW PETROCHEMICAL COMPLEX IN DAMIETTA AT A VALUE OF $1.4 BILLION
The project will provide 1900 job opportunities for Egyptians. The Authority stipulated that the project would export no less than 50% of its production.
A report compiled by the People's Assembly's Health Committee recommended the fixation of the prices of the basic medicines and the observation of the pharmaceutical companies' economies so that such companies could not be exposed to losses or stoppage. It also recommended the building of domestic technology by 2005 that will be capable of development and invention and can help national pharmaceutical industry boost investments in the field of research and development.
The People's Assembly highlighted the importance of the expansion of exporting pharmaceutical requirements produced by Egyptian companies in a bid to meet the needs of most Arab countries in which such requirements are not available, such as medicinal glass, gelatin capsules and metal packages. It called for boosting the volume of exportation of Egyptian formulas and raw materials by 2005. There should be joint Egyptian production of the latest pharmaceutical products, the parliament said, calling for using modern methods in industry such as genetic engineering.
They are the three biggest items of expenditure in Egyptian daily life according to studies and statistics and eat up the bulk of the family income.
Surprisingly, in spite of the rise in the consumption of protein like meat and fish, which may indicate a better level of nutrition, the National Research Centre's latest studies indicate a spread of malnutrition diseases among the Egyptians like overweight, anaemia and iron and calcium shortage.
Egyptians are among the peoples with the highest tea consumption in the world as the per capita consumption average amounts to two thousand cups annually!
The Mobile...
Some important professionals like doctors, engineers and businessmen whose work requires an urgent use of the mobile especially in emergency cases highlight the importance of the mobile, too.
According to the researches conducted by the National Centre for Social and Criminal Researches, the budget of private lessons consumes at least a quarter of the family income as 100% of Thanaweya Ama students take private lessons and 90% of first and second years secondary have them, which not only affects the family income distribution but also marginalizes the role of the educational establishment and undermines the citizens confidence in it so much so that the free education concept has become void of its meaning and education has turned into a commodity subject to speculation, which has made the democratization of education theory simply meaningless.
However, the problem is that Arab leaders regard themselves as pro-American and have put their efforts at the disposal of the Zionist military effort, backing the United States and Israel, for the security of the Americans and the Israelis is that of Arab leaders, whose safety depends on the safety of American interests. This attitude has made Arab leaders put themselves at the service of American aggression, contributing the financial capabilities and military forces of their countries to it. When things take an adverse course that makes it imperative to reinforce and protect the domestic front, Arab leaders regard their soldiers as mercenaries and insult their own subjects by treating them as bullies. The worst example of this sort of attitude was given by Egyptian Prime Minister Atef Ebeid, who made statements for which he should have been court-martialled, as he combines premiership with the post of military governor by virtue of the emergency law that has been in effect in Egypt since 1981. In this capacity, Dr Ebeid has referred citizens to courts - martial without any of them committing a crime that can even be compared to what he himself had done, for he has insulted all Egypt, civilians and military alike, humiliating and degrading them and distorting their national and patriotic history.
A similar state of affairs existed in the late 1940's and early 1950's, when corruption was rife due to the alliance of the Royal Palace with the British occupation forces in the presence of minority governments, which was a recipe with only one possible result: an explosion, i.e. the Revolution. The situation now stands as follows:
Then it would be time to complete the vital part of Sharon's project and start implementing what is known as Jordanian option, as a foster country to which the Palestinians could be sent. Within the context of establishing the concept of the foster country, it is expected that the battle will take the form of a civil war between the Jordanians and the Palestinians, so as to weaken all the forces that have the ability to resist.
Arab intellectuals must adhere to the option of resistance and increase the effectiveness of the boycott of all the commodities and products of the enemy. They must also continue to mobilize and raise the state of alert of the people to defend life, property and honour.
Asked about a reform in the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), the Palestinian official said the reform was not in compliance with Israeli-U.S. demands as Sharon's reform is aimed to destroy the PNA.
He said he has no personal, political or security ambition and mass media reports in this respect are merely ridiculous.
Blasting martyrdom operations, he said the bombers do not put national interest and security into account.
I think that these operations require an evaluative pause from all political forces. The remedy for them can be provided through political and dialogue, rather than security, means."
He went on to say, "I am an officer so I can not leave (Palestine) without Arafat's permission. Reports circulated by agencies connected with the Israeli enemy on expulsion and exile are ridiculous.
2,250,000 PALESTINIANS LIVE UNDER LINE OF POVERTY
The specimen for this portion of the survey comprised 2,917 families, including 1,943 in the West Bank and 974 in Gaza Strip. It was possible to interview a total of 2,439 families, including 1,530 in the West Bank and 909 in Gaza Strip.
Meanwhile, 27.4% of the families even agreed to clear the Palestinian market of those Israeli goods that could not be replaced. This was the opinion of 28.9% of the families interviewed in the West Bank and 24.3% of the families interviewed in Gaza Strip.
Well-informed Palestinian sources in Amman told Al-Hayat that a quadruple meeting comprising security officials from the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Egypt would be held in Cairo or Washington next week within the framework of cooperation between those countries to restructure Palestinian security system.
The sources ruled out reports about deposing Al-Rajoub from his post adding that it is too early to think of positions and their occupants as it is likely that Al-Rajoub would play a role in the next stage that precedes the arrival of American Central Intelligence Agency George Tennet in the region.
RANTISI: WE'LL ANNOUNCE FRESH DOCUMENT FOR RESISTING OCCUPATION
The same reports pointed out that Taif and Cairo were suggested to host such a conference to which Hamas, Islamic Jihad, Fatah and other Palestinian factions are supposed to participate.
Saudi Arabia is too honourable to call for halting the resistance of occupation."
Rantisi regarded the statements made by Egyptian and Syrian foreign ministers about the communiqué adopted in Sharm El-Sheikh summit as a candid explanation pointing out that the Israeli occupation, rather than the Palestinian resistance, was the one meant by "ceasing violence."
Sheikh Ahmad Yassin, spiritual leader of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), affirmed that no Arab country had asked Hamas to halt resistance operations against Israel. He said in an interview with Al Ahram that what was being said about contacts with Hamas for arranging a meeting with its representatives and those of the Palestinian Authority in an Arab capital under the auspices of a sisterly Arab country was completely baseless. "Nobody has brought this idea to Hamas' attention.
"However," he added, "the number of Palestinian women and children who were martyred since the beginning of martyrdom operations is many times that of killed Israelis, so why do they want to throw the blame on the Palestinians for the killed Israelis and not hold Israel responsible for this large number of martyred women and children?"
As for Israel's suspension of military operations in Gaza Strip, Sheikh Yassin said that it was motivated by Israel's awareness that its losses in Gaza would be substantial and that massacres could occur there and the world would not keep silent about them, not to mention the pressure applied by Egypt to prevent an Israeli storming of Gaza.
Sheikh Yassin responded to a question about whether he thought that the time was right for a substitute leadership to take Yasser Arafat's place by saying that Arafat's replacement at the present stage would serve Israel's interest, as Israel was trying to find someone who would cooperate with it. "If Arafat cooperates with Israel a hundred per cent, he will be a hero in its eyes. But if he cooperates with it at only fifty per cent, it will look for somebody worse for the Palestinians to replace him."
"Yasser Arafat will not please America and Israel, even if he gives them Sheikh Yassin's head and the heads of all Palestinians," he said. "We have no choice but to continue the struggle and the resistance whether they brand us as terrorists or not. We are defending our rights and our homeland, and we seek martyrdom and pray to Allah to grant it to us. We have thousands of young people who wish to be martyred. We are not afraid of death."
Ali Gaddi and Kamal Qamazi, prominent leaders of the Front's Algeria-based components, called for voting for the lists that defended religion and Islamic values, which was interpreted by the observers as a call for voting for the National Reform Movement Party and the Nahda Party. The observers attributed this interpretation to the fact that these parties had opened their arms to the repentant Islamists who benefited from the Civil Concord Law and the old officials of the Front. They pointed out that Mahfouz Nihnah's Peace Community Movement came second to the above-mentioned two parties in that call. Gaddi and Qamazi affirmed that "reconciliation" was the only way for getting out of the crisis that had existed for a decade, indicating that reconciliation required releasing the detained party leaders, ending the state of emergency, declaring the real status of the missing persons and carrying the responsibility for the victims of the national tragedy.
Algerian Interior Minister Yazid Zarhuni said that the Government had crossed the names of all "repentant" members of the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) and others who had benefited from the 1999 general amnesty issued by the President off voter lists and so they would not be able to vote in the forthcoming elections.
Making light of the fears expressed by the political forces competing for the seats of the next Parliament, Zarhuni said that those who talked about forfeit of votes beforehand were the one who felt that they would lose the elections.
UNPRECEDENTLY LIBYA OPENS THE DOOR TO FOREIGN INVESTORS

MOSCOW, ALGIERS AGREE TO BOOST MILITARY COOPERATION
He added that Algeria was a traditional partner of Russia in many fields, including the delivery of weapons systems and military equipment, the training of military cadres and the exchange of military advisers and experts.
In response to such reports, "Saidal" Pharmaceuticals Complex director Ali Awn said in a press conference that Algeria had never had any relations with Israel.
"In Egypt, there are about 350 and 400 Indian programmers thanks to the leap India achieved in such a field, as its software exports hit some 8.5 billion dollars, let alone the large number of experts, trainees and skilled labour particularly in the software domain," said the Cabinet's Information and Decision Support Centre head Eng. Ra'fat Radwan.
The Egyptian software sector has no need of foreign labour, said the Egyptian Federation of Industries' Chamber of Software Industry head Sayyed Ismail. Egyptian programmers have the efficiency and skill that enable them to work in major Arab as well as foreign companies in the region, he added. In addition, the partnership agreements related to training and programming signed with international software firms could qualify and train the Egyptian labour in such a field, he pointed out. The plans drawn up by the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology provide the highest level of training and could meet the requirements of the software market, he said.
Everybody agreed that the industry modernization programme financed by the EU is considered a step that should be synchronized with a programme for developing the scientific centres to manufacture the productive technology and bolster its relation with the industrial units with a view to constantly putting their researches into effect.
The retreat in the productive technology of the Egyptian industry is attributed to the companies' failure to get the required investments necessary for completing their projects and upgrading their equipment. There were also no financial allocations for importing modern technology and production requirements, in addition to the fixation of a price policy regardless of the high cost of products, something that makes most companies incur losses after they used to make profits. In addition, there are some administrative reasons including the governmental bureaucracy and the lack of strong administrative structures capable of development in order to modernize production, he added.
The priorities laid down by the Government to get the Egyptian economy out of the dark tunnel prepared the climate of attracting foreign and domestic investments, something that made the Government set up the General Authority for Investment, said Fawzi. "The Government canceled some provisions that impede the inflow of capital into the country. It also issued the law no.8 for the year 1997 on investment incentives."
However, such an ideal image has another face that has to be repaired, i.e. redressing the bad customs deformations that lead to the high cost of domestic product in comparison to the foreign counterpart, thus making the consumer either in Egypt or abroad resort to buy the product that is low in price and better in quality at the same time. If we produce good commodities, the foreign ones are good enough and their price is lower, he added.
It is completely unfair."
He also called on the industrialists to set up departments in every major industrial installation. As for the societies that sponsor investors' interests who have small-sized projects, they should direct the unexploited capacities in the industrial activities with a view to making full ideal use of them and determining financial allocations in the companies' balance sheet in a bid to pay heed to research and development.

The law also stipulates a punishment of 15 lashes and a fine of not less than LE100 and not more than LE300 for anyone who possesses, buys, delivers, produces or transports alcoholic beverages for personal consumption.
Despite the fact that the series of strategic cooperation agreements that Israel and the United States have concluded since 1981 meet Israel's intelligence requirements, including satellite imagery that Tel Aviv receives from American spy satellites, Israel wants to have full independence in this field, for fear that America may someday hold back certain information that Israel needs to meet the requirements of its strategic planning - a scenario that could make Israel spy on the United States itself, as happened in the Jonathan Pollard case and others.
4- There is also the economic advantage that spy satellites give to Israel, which can sell its spy satellites to friendly countries, such as Turkey that has already asked Tel Aviv for a quotation on development of a spy satellite for it. India has also approached Israel with an offer of participation in the Indian program for producing satellites for espionage, telecommunications, navigation and meteorology.
Syrian President, Bashaar Al-Assad uncovered his country's differences with Saudi Arabia over the initiative of Saudi Crown Prince, Abdullah Bin Abdul-Aziz. Al-Assad also voiced grief for the disastrous status that Arab conditions had reached.
Al-Assad said that it was true that the three Arab leaders had met in Sharm Al-Sheikh but they tried to avoid issuing any final statement reviewing and adopting the views put forward during the summit. He added that step was the real achievement they had made due to the intensity of pressure. Consultations were made during the tripartite meeting, he said, and differences popped up and the opinions were far from identical. To avoid embarrassment they decided not to issue a final statement, thus making their summit the only exception to the rule.
He had asked to be the first speaker in the conference but just before he gave his address, the American ambassador in Cairo gave him a message asking him in a threatening tone not to use a strong tone in his address, but the Syrian President's reply was an even stronger tone, according to what he said to Arab lawyers.
A security and political reform blueprint has already been finalized following two weeks of secret security talks in Washington among four U.S., Egyptian, Israeli and Palestinian teams, headed by U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Chief George Tennet, Israeli Mossad Chief, Palestinian President Yasser Arafat's Political Advisor Mohamed Rashid, and three leading Palestinian security officials.
Arafat should okay the political and security reform blueprint within a couple of weeks and promise the U.S. Administration to put it into force and give guarantees to bring about changes and reforms as soon as possible during CIA Chief George Tennet's repeatedly delayed tour in the Middle East region, which will include Egypt, Jordan, Palestine and Israel. In the tour, three additional meetings will be held in the occupied Palestinian territories on the formulation of new arrangements to adjust the situation in the occupied territories. Meanwhile, the U.S. Administration will vow to pressure the Sharon government to stop violations, aggressive practices and incursions, about which Egypt and the PNA are in doubt. Therefore, they demand Israel to pull its forces out of the Palestinian-controlled territories and request the Sharon government to give a written promise to completely stop incursions as a precondition for the PNA's implementation of the plan.
Egyptian Intelligence Agency Chief Omar Solayman on Saturday discussed with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat a plan to restructure the Palestinian security services, which was termed by the Palestinian leadership as "very complicated", Al-Hayat learnt. German-Egyptian cooperation is also underway to help restructure the Palestinian agencies with a U.S. support, sources said.
Meanwhile, Al-Hayat learnt from U.S. sources in Washington that Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk Shareh was expected to visit Washington and New York mid-June to hold talks with U.S. officials and attend meetings of the U.N. Security Council, which Syria chairs this month.
Even if invited, Syria will not attend the conference due to the formula underway as it sees that the Arab initiative, initiated by Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah bin Abdel-Aziz, is the base, along with U.N. resolutions and the land-for-peace principle, the sources added. This conference will scrap Madrid peace terms of reference, a thing which is vehemently rejected by Syria.
"Cooperation between Egyptian and American security services continues, and it has achieved great success against terrorism," he said.
Knowledgeable sources said that they believed that the young man, whose identity remains unknown, was not a Sinai resident, as he had been arrested in an area that was strictly monitored, which indicated that he was not familiar with the desert tracks that could be used for crossing the border away from security surveillance.

CHINA DEMANDS TO IMPORT CARS FROM EGYPT
Another joint investment projects are being prepared in the field of pharmaceuticals to produce a medicine for curing hepatitis disease in Egypt through joint investment in the industrial zones, in addition to cultivation of some new vital plants and cooperation in some other scientific research fields, Al- Aref said.
There are fresh investments with India in the fields of software, information technology and engineering industries that will be discussed in the current stage, he said.
These statements came in a symposium held by the UNIDO in Egypt in cooperation with the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones on the small and medium-sized development support programme in cooperation with Italian companies.
The agreement was signed by Executive Chairman and Board Member Gasim Al Manai,on behalf of the Programme and Board Chairman Ahmed Dia' Eddin Fahmi on behalf of the National Bank of Egypt.
He called for making the best use of the facilities and services to contribute to giving momentum to the march of development and construction in Arab countries.
The program included the transformation of some economic bodies, that should be developed, into holding companies, and the transmittance of public treasury net worth in 30 economic bodies and three companies to the National Investment Bank (NIB), Al-Sharif added, pointing out that the program ensures the preservation of the public ownership of the economic bodies (16 in number) that own and run strategic activities, confirms the care of the low-income people and rationalizes low cost services.
CENTRAL BANK' FINANCIAL POSITION IMPROVES BY LE22 BILLION
ECONOMISTS: DEALING IN EURO IN LIEU OF DOLLAR TO GET OUT OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS
They pointed out that laws ban banks from trading or speculating in gold prices. The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) is the only bank allowed to buy gold to form its strategic reserve and to sell that gold when it needs financial liquidity.
Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) approved the rise of Misr Iran Development Bank's (MIDB) paid capital from $109 million to $150 million.
On the other hand, Al-Sahar said, "A number of MIDB activities have been recently developed, new modern services have been introduced such as phone banking services, automated teller machines and credit cards.
The regional director of the bank's branches, Ahmed Dabbous abruptly announced his resignation.
It might be mentioned that sources with American Express (Egypt branches) had confirmed that bank's board in New York had given orders last Thursday denying Dabbous access to the bank's branch in Cairo, axing him and giving him an open vacation. However, Dabbous said that he resolutely did not go to the bank on last Thursday and that he was not dismissed, adding that he would willingly tender his resignation without any pressure from anybody.
The American Express Bank is considered one of the major foreign bank branches operative in Egypt whose number of branches is 21. The capital of its branches in Egypt exceeds 50 million dollars. The volume of its business exceeds one billion dollars. It contributed 40% to the Egyptian American Bank. A year ago, the bank announced that it was bent on restructuring its activities in Egypt through purchasing a quota in the Egyptian American Bank and maintaining its regional office that runs its branches in Egypt.
2002/2003 The coming five-year plan aims at enhancing the balance of trade and decreasing the deficit through increasing exports by a rate over than that of imports, depending on exporting a number of commodities that achieved preferential privileges on foreign markets in the last few years together with restoring the markets that the Egyptian commodities have lost, said Minister of Planning, Dr. Othman Mohamed Othman.
To achieve this end, the plan depends on the targeted increase in the exports of the commodity sectors. This increase is about 13% on average during the plan years at a rate of 12.4% in the first year.
The plan also aims at taking the engineering commodity exports up by 13.5% annually especially as far as the exports of tools, electric appliances and means of transport are concerned. Egyptian industry holds a competitive position in the household electric appliances, electronics, means of transport, production input of filters and electric and metal parts that can be exported to Arab, African, East European and CIS markets.
This will be synchronized with the State striving for restoring traditional markets of cotton, opening new markets for exporting it and paying attention to flower exports.
He said that the government should admit this particularly as there is a fall too in the rate of economic growth year after year.
Othman said that withdrawing confidence from the public sector leads to a fall in private sector investments pointing to the relationship between the two sectors and adding that this relation should not be dominated by competition for getting sources of financing. The relationship should be one of complementarity, he said. The minister said that there is no alternative to attracting foreign investments to revive the Egyptian economy in the light of the gap in the rate of savings. He demanded that the uncomfortable look at foreign investments in Egypt should be changed.
In a press conference he held yesterday, Chairman of the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones Dr. Mohamed Al-Ghamrawi stressed that the free zones exports hiked from 60 million dollars in 2000 to 947 million dollars in 2001, while they recorded 456 million dollars during the first five months of this year. The free zones exports are expected to exceed one billion dollars by the end of this year as they are estimated this year at over 91 million dollars monthly, he added.
The volume of Egyptians' investments out of the total investments during the last thirty years represents 75%, while the rest are owned by Arabs and foreigners, Al-Ghamrawi said, pointing out that Arab investments are still poor especially as Egypt is economically qualified for attracting more Arab investments from abroad.
On the other hand, Al-Ghamrawi pointed out that the number of companies that had been registered in 2001 hit 1580 whose issued capital reached 6.899 billion pounds and investment cost hit 21.48 billion pounds. However, 1818 companies were set up in 2000 with issued capital hitting 7.622 billion pounds, while their investment cost hit 16.394 billion pounds.
The session, entitled "Towards the Development of Arab Trade," will result in inventing new finance methods to develop the inter-Arab trade, which suffers from a remarkable weakness in its growth rates and its total rates of trade exchange with the external world, Al-Hayat learned.
In its meeting yesterday under the chairmanship of Prime Minister Dr. Atef Ebeid, the cabinet decided to take practical procedures to activate the foreign markets of the contracting companies. It also approved the establishment of two power stations under the BOOT system.
"The cabinet recommended reviewing the financial positions of the companies that will work abroad and the establishment of a fund in the Contractors Union to be financed via collecting 0.5 percent out of the value of the external works of the companies abroad."
These complaints came as a quick reaction to the successive and abrupt mark-up of the reinforcing iron prices, which hiked from 950 pounds per ton in January 2002 to some 1.580 pounds in July 2002. Contracting and construction experts expect the price of iron per ton to hit 1800 pounds in the coming few weeks if the current situation continues and if the state and the concerned bodies don't intervene.
ESTABLISHMENT OF 20 NEW CITIES COMPLETED WITH LE11.4 BILLION
He added that the New Communities Authority had built 4,281 kilometres of roads and laid down 7037 kilometres of water pipelines that were fed by 20 water-purification stations with a daily capacity of 1.1 million cubic metres. "The New Communities Authority has also built 4,650 kilometres of sanitary drainage pipelines and 6 water-treatment stations that have a combined daily capacity of 460,000 cubic metres per day, in addition to laying down electrical networks covering 26,000 kilometres and landscaping 65,000 feddans of green belts around new cities.
These companies made losses of 89.7 million pounds against 81.1 million pounds last fiscal year, an increase of 8.6 million pounds. This is attributed to an increase in the stockpile that hit 449 million pounds, the report said.
The report uncovered most of the external trade companies suffering from deficiency of their financial structure.
The customers' balances and securities at most of external trade companies have been inflated.

DEALINGS IN ISRAELI SHEKEL BACK IN EXCHANGE COMPANIES
They pointed out that the shekel is sold at 75 piasters, with the buying price standing at 70 piasters only.

Asharq Al-Awsat learnt from the family of the Egyptian nun, Fayza Ayad Samuel who was besieged together with some Palestinians inside the nativity Church in Bethlehem by Israeli security forces for about a couple of months that the Israeli government had asked those in charge of the Nativity Church that the Egyptian nun be cross-questioned by it. When she refused that demand, the Israeli authorities ordered that the Egyptian nun leave Bethlehem altogether.

SECRETS OF SOCIAL FUND SECRETARY GENERAL'S DEPOSITION!

Unit personnel said in their message that they had joined the war in Jenin from its very start when 13 Israeli soldiers had been killed in the camp and that they had demolished several Palestinian houses and risked their lives in the operation, just like their colleagues from the other engineer unit, so that why had that unit been awarded the Medal of Honour while theirs had not?

He was shouting, "I want Mahmoud!?" When I asked him who that Mahmoud was, he did not answer and I simply awoke. Reform, Or Palestinian Resistance?
Brother Khalid said that the Palestinian people wanted reforms, but it wanted them for Palestinian reasons and to realize Palestinian interests and treat Palestinian ailments, not to meet American-Israeli priorities whose aim was to ease the pressure off Ariel Sharon.
In other words, Hamas insists that ending the occupation should be a part of political reform and that resistance should be the means for realizing this end.
The situation was "very serious" because reform was proposed as a substitute for resistance and the Palestinian Authority had entered into an American-Israeli reform process whose aim was to enlarge its security role to pressure the resistance and the resistance cadres, he said.
"Second, there is the religious dimension, i.e. the people's sense of responsibility for the sanctums of Muslims and their bonding with martyrdom and Al Aqsa Mosque."

Yesterday, it was announced in Ankara that Caesar would discuss in the Iranian capital the ways and means of promoting cooperation to combat terrorism.
The Turkish party expects a visit will be arranged to Tabriz where an Azerbaijani origin majority lives.
Caesar will try in Tehran to activate means of security cooperation agreed upon by the Interior Ministries in the two countries with a view to achieving greater Turkish military superiority over the remnants of Kurdistani Party elements on the triangle of Iranian-Turkish and Iraqi borders.

After its foreign investments were plundered during the Iraqi invasion, which led to filing lawsuits in three continents to recover huge funds that had been embezzled in coordination with former senior officials in the London-based Kuwaiti investment office, Kuwait has restructured its foreign investments and external and internal investment policy.
These amendments include turning London office into an integral part of the Investment General Authority in Kuwait after it had been an independent organization. In addition, an administrative and financial link was established, which means that dealings are about to be automated.

Powell told Al-Hayat that President Bush has not backtracked from his goal - the establishment of a Palestinian state.

The American Secretary of State said, "We're looking forward to working with Palestinian leaders, President Yasser Arafat and the rest."
The leaks published in some Hebrew and American newspapers, in addition to the statement given by President Mubarak to New York Times and then to CNN delineate the features of that settlement, which will certainly be frustrating to Arab hopes especially at the popular level.
President Mubarak has talked about the Palestinian President staying for one more year only while Sharon sent his tanks to destroy his presidential complex and shell his own bedroom but this triggered no protests on the part of Egypt, Saudi Arabia or America.
Seventhly, the Iraqi and the Iranian files and in a lesser degree, the Syrian file have come to occupy a high priority for American strategy. Any effective tackling of such files would be meaningless without a practical Saudi, Egyptian and Gulf involvement in any military action against them. The Iraqi position causes concern and the Iranian armament is worrisome and Syria's harbouring some extremist Palestinian organizations' bureaus, besides supporting the Islamic resistance in South Lebanon (Hezbollah) has become a red line for both Israel and the USA.
In a nutshell, the Palestinian people would not accept any settlement whose outlines are of Sharon's making and sponsored by Arab leaderships that seek succour for its alliance with Washington or more economic aid or extension of stay in power or all such goals in toto.
During his visit to Washington and meeting with the US President George Bush, President Hosni Mubarak turned down an American request to hold a meeting with the Zionist Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.
CBE GOVERNOR: EFFORTS TO STRIKE OFF EGYPT FROM THE LIST OF MONEY LAUNDERING
Replying to a question about this issue the CBE governor emphasized that the IFWG considered the efforts exerted by Egypt not enough to strike its name off the list as Egypt contented itself with issuing a law a fortnight ago to combat money laundering.
The CBE governor pointed out that there should be other steps, among which are the issuance of the executive statute of the money laundering combatting law, or starting implementation of the passed law, and the issuance of the presidential decree regarding the establishment of a unit with the CBE to follow up any cases.
The Egyptian reply to these demands crystallized in the issuance of a law which incriminate money laundering operations. The law was endorsed by the parliament before the end of its current session.

The Government started to expand operations of electric power purchases from foreign companies operating under BOOT system. The buying operations have been completed even though the government did not need that energy and in spite of an enormous surplus of idle government stations.
The sum paid to foreign companies in hard currency which is expected to reach about $100 million this year is considered losses incurred by national economy due to the insistence of foreign companies to collect it in dollars in accordance with the contracts concluded by the government with foreign companies, which make it incumbent upon Egypt to buy quotas of electric stations production.

As for G.S.E.CC holders, they are granted a 2-year diploma.
Israel said such reports meant that Egypt is backtracking on its decision to market natural gas to Israel. Such a step, it explained, is tantamount to refusing to cooperate with the Israeli government as Libya's getting of a quota from MIDOR Company would make the possibility of a return to Egyptian-Israeli cooperation in that field (including selling gas to Israel) seem slight.
It is noteworthy that MIDOR started refining petroleum for Gulf companies in Saudi Arabia and Qatar after the withdrawal of the Israeli investor from it. Such companies refused to deal with MIDOR due to Israeli investor's contribution to it.

Israel dumps its nuclear waste in the areas of Ein al-Godirat and al-Kosaima near the Egyptian borders, according to Dr. Ismael al-Ramly an Egyptian water expert at the United Nations.
He concluded that Israel dumps the waste of this nuclear reactor at the areas of al-Kosaima and Ein al-Godirat in eastern Sinai near the Egyptian borders. Analyses of samples of water in the two areas showed that Israel dumps this nuclear waste in the rifted lime rock layer of the Eocene geological time, he said. Israel chose this lime Eocene layer to avoid the pollution of its subterranean water, he said, adding that this layer slopes down to Israel so it constitutes a natural dividing line between its water and Egyptian subterranean water. Therefore, there is no need to have concerns over Egyptian subterranean water in Sinai for only Israeli water is polluted, he concluded.
Mr. El-Refai noted that the research papers of Egyptian scientists had been made use of by the Mossad but the Governmental reply which came from Al-Shazli made him backpedal on his position saying that he had not for a moment doubted the patriotism of Egyptian scientists as he only meant that their researches have been obtained by the Israelis through some means or other without any Egyptian scientists' involvement in that matter.
He pointed out that the programme had once protected two pharaonic tombs, one of Citi I and the other for Ramses I. Hawass added that the Valley of Kings area had been repeatedly exposed to extreme damage caused by floods, rock slides and crystal line formations resulting from moisture.

In response to a question about her estimation of some Egyptian quarters adopting the call for boycotting lists of American products, she said those moves do not serve Egypt's interests. Justifying her stand, she said that such products contain materials that are produced in Egypt. "Hundreds of Egyptians work at such projects and, therefore, the boycott will do harm to the Egyptian raw materials and input that are used in producing such commodities. It will also make the rates of unemployment among Egyptians who work at such restaurants and companies hike."
The new year's state draft budget, if passed, will aggravate poverty through increasing commodity and service prices with illusory rises in pay, they said.
EXAMINATION OF LABOUR PARTY CASE PUT OFF TILL AUTUMN
An administrative decree was therefore passed freezing its activity and suspending the issuance of its organ.
The examination of 3 other lawsuits to found new parties has also been postponed - Al-Sharia, Al-Nil and Mubarak Al-Nahda in addition to another lawsuit demanding that Ibrahim Shukri not be recognized as Labour Party leader.
Furthermore, before the ruling had been pronounced , St Mark Episcopate Patriarch and Pope of Alexandria, Pope Shenouda III had stated that he was not sure how the Copts would react if the court ruled that the newspaper should be republished adding that he would not comment on the ruling whatever it was. Had that ruling been pronounced by any other court whose rulings could be revoked, the church could have appealed against it, but the ruling ,however, was pronounced by the Supreme Administrative Court, the highest judicial body whose rulings are irrevocable. We are contented that in the whereases of the ruling, the court condemned the newspaper's report.

Because all foreign circles, from the American the trade representative to the IMF and the World Bank and the assessment organizations and the representatives of the donor nations, do not stop exerting pressure to push the government to further "liberation" of the exchange rate, the Egyptian decision makers have become convicted of the need to take a step in that direction to preserve their "good" relations with these quarters.
This really serious question is directed at the Atef Ebeid government from the Central Auditing Agency (CAA) which is a major control organ.
The CAA revealed that amendments have been introduced to the Egyptian-American agreement on a category entitled "cash transfer grants". Egypt got a total of three billion dollars under this category placed in a special account with the Central Bank of Egypt by the Ministry of Finance.

Other parts were sold to Click which is another financial federation to which Vodafone is considered the main contributor. The IT sector was liberalized in 2000, thus decreasing the fees of subscribing to the Internet from hundreds of dollars monthly to almost free of charge access at present.
Commenting on the postponement of putting Telecom Egypt up for privatization, minister of communications and information technology said that the company would not be floated at any price thanks to the company's good financial position. Telecom Egypt is considered one of the strongest communications companies in the Middle East, as there is no communications company in the region that has 6 million fixed lines, the minister said, stressing that the company is not hasty to take a privatization decision for it is just a practical decision.
In addition, Egypt has the largest number of university graduates, most of its population are youths and has low-wage rates.

A 70% increase in its budget would also be introduced to meet the expenses of mobilizing Palestinian youths for suicidal operations. Last year, some differences between the financial officials of Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad had urged Jihad movement leaders to ask that their budget be made at their leadership's direct disposal.
The advisors told the British Sunday Telegraph on Sunday that Sharon is serious about getting rid of the Palestinian leader, and he recently told them that Arafat is now playing in "injury time".
Under the motto "Jenin Camp", the Nationalist Islamic Conference, which was held in Beirut during the last two days, wound up its activities and announced its recommendations in a final statement on the Arab-Israeli conflict, besiege and aggression on Iraq, democracy and human rights, development and the challenges of globalization and boosting the relation between the Arab nationalist and Islamic trends.

OPPOSITION AT EGYPTIAN PARLIAMENT AGAINST STATE DRAFT BUDGET
Meanwhile, Minister of Finance Medhat Hassanain condemned the opposition's accusations against the government posing more burdens on the public debt through issuing bonds in hard currency (the U.S. dollar).

WHERE DID THIRTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS GO?
The representative of the CAA spoke to the People's Assembly to express the authority's disappointment after it failed to get detailed information on the spending of the loans and grants offered by international funds and banks by the USA government, and by some Arab funds and governments.
The CAA said that the amendment-21 introduced to that category on June 4, 2000 led to financing the subsidization of the states public budget and the financing of the salaries, bonuses, and budgets of employees at the Ministry of International Cooperation and the Finance Ministry beside other bank deposits from some quarters whose returns are used to finance their activities without those activities being specified.
The report attributed the big growth rates of investments that were witnessed by this sector to the increase in the volume of the Egyptian communications sector due to the retreat in the number of mobile users in Egypt in comparison to the number of the population that hit 67 million souls. Therefore, the three million users of mobile phone constitute a ratio of less than 5 percent.
The possibility of the growth of the cellular phone Communications and the extension of the fixed phone networks is still high, the report said, pointing out that although the two mobile phone companies have achieved rapid growth in the 1990s, this growth continued in 2000 and 2001.
The report pointed out that Telecom Egypt had achieved a growth rate of over 70 percent and that the Government, through the liberalization drive, was striving for encouraging the establishment and operation of private companies competing with Telecom Egypt and getting part of communications revenues.
Egypt, therefore, pay to giant world companies such as Microsoft and IBM to train the Egyptian graduates whom it employs in the IT sector with a view to bolstering Egypt's position as a centre for developing software, export-oriented companies and communications industry. At present, most of Arab software programmes as well as all the related services are produced in Egypt.

They stressed the national unity of the Palestinian people with all its factions, calling for aborting any schemes that aim at exploding the Palestinian internal situation.
The Egyptian scientist, told Asharq Al-Awsat that he could extract all information on tritium or "H 3" through over 500 scientific studies carried out by Israel since 1953.

MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS CRITICIZES CALL FOR BOYCOTTING US PRODUCTS
Opposition blocs at the Egyptian parliament announced their opposition to the state draft budget, development drive and new five-year plan just a few hours before the parliamentary session on the drafts on Monday.
In response to the members' criticisms, the minister said "There is no country in the world which does not count on loan funding in its investments. The banks' task is to attract deposits and then inject them as investments."
The lawsuit filed by the committee chairman Dr Moustafa Kamal Helmi against the Islamic Labour Party was based on the pretext that the latter had modified its platform and goals according to which it had been founded without notifying the committee in accordance with the law provisions. Some financial deviations have also been investigated by the Socialist Public Prosecutor's Office. Some of the party's leaders, furthermore, have fallen out over its leadership.
Chief of the defence panel, lawyer Mahfouz Azzam said, "the case is based on a report from the Committee on Political Parties, which is a government committee with administrative decisions based on state security investigations, which is a political system that has nothing to do with criminal offences."
Egyptian Coptic and Church milieus are witnessing a new crisis due to the return of Al Naba newspaper which published sexual scandals of a defrocked monk in 2001, thus creating a sensation and triggering demonstrations as the Copts considered the issue harmful to the Egyptian Church's reputation.

WILL THE GOVERNMENT RAISE THE OFFICIAL DOLLAR RATE OF EXCHANGE TO FIVE POUNDS?
The most serious question so far directed at the Atef Ebeid government since it was formed is this: Egypt has over the last six years obtained 35 billion dollars from foreign countries, banks, and institutions in the form of grants and loans in implementation of 628 agreements with these quarters.
These loans and grants total more than 35 billion dollars. Egypt obtained these funds in implementation of 628 agreements.
$1.2 BILLION INVESTMENTS OF COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECTORS
To elaborate, out of a total of 6 million lines, the current usage only hits 10 percent, the report said. Last year, the new lines increased by 25 percent. So, the Government expects this sector to be an important source for investment, employment and income. To prove the priority given by the Government to this sector, the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology has been set up in 1999 to lay down a national plan for communications and information technology with a view to developing this sector.
The current available growth rates point out that competition between the two cellular phone companies could be boosted especially as a third company is about to provide the same service. This will make both of them concentrate on increasing the number of subscribers through providing more innovated and improved products at more competitive prices.
The deregulation of the mobile phone sector showed the importance of competition as Telecom Egypt's revenues, for instance, hiked by 25 percent because another company has set up a new network without much cost. Telecom Egypt managed to overcome the sharp decrease of the international tariff, the report noted.
Smart Village The report pointed out that the IT exports totaled 50 million dollars last year. The Government seeks to increase them to 1 billion dollars. To attain this end, the Government started to set up the Smart Village project. It laid down the infrastructure required by communications and IT companies and allocated many free technological zones in which the price per square meter hits one dollar.
SHARON MULLS OVER EXPELLING ARAFAT TO CYPRUS
Sharon regards that his new idea to arrest the Palestinian leader and transfer him to Cyprus by air is a renunciation of his previous idea to assassinate him and a compromise which rules out the use of violence, the advisors added. The fresh thought invented by Sharon will also be largely seconded by both Israeli and U.S. public opinions and pave the way for restructuring the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), hence, returning to the negotiating table, they added.
The conferees called for decisively rejecting and confronting the American threats to Iraq, insisting on the necessity of immediately raising the blockade imposed on it and cancelling all that might threaten its sovereignty. They also called for cancelling the so-called no-fly zones in the north and south of Iraq and supporting the Iraqi steadfastness with all possible governmental and popular means.
On June 22nd, the political, economic and banking milieus were taken aback by the continuation of the IFWG's including Egypt on the non-cooperative 15 countries and removing four countries including Lebanon, Hungary, Israel and St. Kitts and Nevis.
He added that such steps included the People's Assembly's endorsement of the money laundering combatting law, the CBE's issuance of the regulations of "Identify your Client" and circulating them among all the banks, and the issuance of similar regulations at the levels of the insurance and capital market sectors, in addition to cooperation in the international field and training and holding meetings with the Middle East Review Group, affiliated to the IFWG.
Egyptian sources told Asharq Al-Awsat that there were forecasts to strike off Egypt's name of the list, due to its commitment to demands announced by the institution.
The Egyptian banks regularly notify the CBE of being void of any money laundering operations, and that some cases that had been reported to be involved in money laundering operations had been monitored and proved to be unguilty of money laundering, Abdel-Aziz said, asking for lifting the strict restrictions imposed on the Egyptian financial department which always result in confusion of its work movement.
It is noteworthy that contributions of the public banks in Egypt: Banque Misr, National Bank of Egypt, Banque Du Caire and Bank of Alexandria in addition to National Investment Bank represent about 90% of the bank capital while the remaining 10% belong to professional syndicates like commerce faculties graduates and the Bar Association and some individuals.
On the other hand, the extraordinary general assembly of the Nile Bank will hold a meeting next week to increase the capital by 100% to become $80 million instead of a current $40 million.

Helmi called upon banks to adopt the idea of establishing specialized companies boosting the existing industries to surmount the restrictions set by Basel Agreement that negatively impacted on the banks' ability to provide the necessary finance. This is meant to give momentum to industrial activities in Egypt, he said.
He said banks should learn lessons from errors that took place earlier owing to financing unsuccessful projects according to impaired studies.
Minister of Industry and Technological Development Dr. Ali Al-Saidi emphasized that the Egyptian banks are unqualified to serve industry barring three banks mainly including the Industrial Development Bank (IDB).
Al-Saidi stressed that 65% of the capacities of mills and rice mills are not exploited. These mills are being counted up and a schedule is being set to develop them through locally produced machinery and equipment.

Israel chose this lime Eocene layer to avoid the pollution of its subterranean water, he said, adding that this layer slopes down to Israel so it constitutes a natural dividing line between its water and Egyptian subterranean water. Therefore, there is no need to have concerns over Egyptian subterranean water in Sinai for only Israeli water is polluted, he concluded.
Mr. El-Refai noted that the research papers of Egyptian scientists had been made use of by the Mossad but the Governmental reply which came from Al-Shazli made him backpedal on his position saying that he had not for a moment doubted the patriotism of Egyptian scientists as he only meant that their researches have been obtained by the Israelis through some means or other without any Egyptian scientists' involvement in that matter.

Meanwhile, Minister of Finance Medhat Hassanain condemned the opposition's accusations against the government posing more burdens on the public debt through issuing bonds in hard currency (the U.S. dollar).

The representative of the CAA spoke to the People's Assembly to express the authority's disappointment after it failed to get detailed information on the spending of the loans and grants offered by international funds and banks by the USA government, and by some Arab funds and governments.

The report attributed the big growth rates of investments that were witnessed by this sector to the increase in the volume of the Egyptian communications sector due to the retreat in the number of mobile users in Egypt in comparison to the number of the population that hit 67 million souls.

The possibility of the growth of the cellular phone Communications and the extension of the fixed phone networks is still high, the report said, pointing out that although the two mobile phone companies have achieved rapid growth in the 1990s, this growth continued in 2000 and 2001.

Commenting on the decision of the institution, former head of Banks Union Mohamed Abdel-Aziz told Asharq Al-Awsat that impeding removing Egypt's name from the list of uncooperative countries in the field of money laundering is considered a continuation of the foreign pressure on Egypt, pointing out that banks adopted several measures to prevent money laundering cases. One of these measures is the principle of "Identify your Client" which has been generalized in the other financial sectors including insurance.
A bank official said that due to those losses, the general assembly in its recent meeting asked that the bank capital be reduced to LE22.4 million and then increased through new stocks from old shareholders as a step towards structural reform.

Indications show that the rise in living standards had not been accompanied by a parallel improvement in wisdom about spending money.

Every year, 4 million Egyptian subscribers pay LE6 billion in mobile phone bills. The successive decreases in mobile phone call rates, to the degree where they are now close to those of house phones, and the young people's use of mobile telephones for using the Internet and storing the names and phone number of friends, have caused an upsurge in the use of mobile telephones, so that "mobiles" are now a phenomenon and an item of luxury consumption for even some low-income groups. Some studies show that the expenditures of families may go far beyond their income because of some luxury items that aim only at creating a false image, such as mobile phones.

INTERVIEW WITH EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CARBON BLACK COMPANY ON INVESTMENT IN EGYPT
Q. Why have you chosen Egypt to invest in?
I often say that Egypt can become a pocket edition of Japan in view of its available potential and resources such as the geographical location.
Therefore, we felt we had to export all our production.
A- When it became certain that we would not be able to sell our production to the local market, we started to examine export markets. We found that it would be better to export our production, given the geographical location of Egypt, which is considered a good springboard for exports.
This can be achieved in Egypt but not in Europe. Moreover, it is not possible to find in Europe the abidance of the Egyptian people.
There are different problems in all countries, but what should be done is to be honest because in this case the problems can be reviewed and solved, which may take some time.
CITRUS EXPORTERS RELUCTANT TO SIGN EXPORTATION PROTOCOL TO CHINA
The negotiations that were held between the Egyptian and Chinese parties come to a settlement of the majority of issues under dispute.

The leading Jordanian Ikhwanite Sheikh Abdel-Meguid Zunaibat seized on an occasional statement by former parliament speaker, Abdel-Hadi Al-Magali regarding non-national and non-practical agendas to announce that the Ikhwanite movement, despite its decision to participate in the next elections, would seek to participate rather than to dominate.
Al-Magali is trying to emerge once more, together with his (constitutional) party and his role exploiting the need of the officialdom of organized forces to face hardline Islamist contentions should they decide to use them in the prospective elections that will be held in extremely complicated conditions, regionally, politically and economically.
Surprisingly, Al-Magali supposes that the minority he is talking about would use the above-mentioned slogans in the election battle. He is hitting several birds with one stone only lending a climate of political struggle to a battle which has not started yet. He might be given credit for that. He also wants to reemerge as a centrist leader to face hardline forces whether Islamist or non Islamist in the elections. He, then, puts himself forward for the establishment, revitalizes hopeless and dormant cells in the centrist parties and incites the Islamists to reply to him.
This, he added, would run parallel to the historic type of election participation on the part of that trend. Sheikh Zunaibat's clarifications included emphasis that the decision to participate in the elections had not been taken yet as its final referential is Shura (Advisory) Council of the group. He pointed out that the group would not seek to gain a majority if it were to contest the coming elections or rather it would not monopolize the parliament or gain a majority to control fundamental or important issues.
Q: Don't you think that that might make some people accuse you of trying to avert responsibility?

Two days ago in a direct interview with "Dream" satellite channel, Al-Baz said that the file of the vice president is on the cards adding that the President has several options and he is not worried as Egypt is politically mature to choose a new president once the President's term of office expires. He emphasized that President Mubarak did not want to impose a certain option on the Egyptian people as a figure might emerge in the coming period, with better qualifications that the state would need. When Mubarak finds out that it was time he stepped down in favour for somebody else, he will not hesitate at all as he is no advocate of non-rotation of power and only acts for the good of the country.

The Wafdite oppositionist deputy kept on urging the MPs not to approve the loan, affirming that there is an American attempt to interfere in the Egyptian education in the wake of 11th September incidents.

The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) belittled on June 15 the importance of statements made by the new Palestinian Minister of the Interior, Major General Abdel-Razzak Al-Yehia, in which he threatened to "put an end" to the Palestinian movements that carry out operations against Israel.
Al-Rantissi considered that "the Palestinian people rallying around the resistance and its options is the guarantee against any attempt of any party to harm it."
Under the above banner headline, the daily carries its front-page stop story on Israeli nuclear capability. Israel has nuclear sea capabilities, U.S. sources said on Saturday.
By broadening the range of its nuclear arsenal to include the sea, Israel will complicate U.S. efforts to prevent other countries in the Middle East region from trying to have nuclear weapons, posing a nuclear armament race in the Middle East, the sources said.

TIME WHEN WE ARE KILLED BUT WE DO NOT KILL IS OVER: NASRALLAH
In his speech, Nasrallah said, "The time when we were attacked, but we could not attack, when we were hit, but we could not hit, when we were murdered, but could not kill has been over. Threatening and bullying hither and thither do not bring any psychological or moral impact on those threatened by Israel." "The Arab peoples bet on Sharon's hard-line stands for they are staunchly blocking the flood of Arab cessions," he said. He also warned against "confusion between the return of Palestinian refugees and a solution to their problems."

The Peace Society Movement headed by Mahfouz Nahnah, on the other hand, announced freezing its activity in the parliamentary establishment pending the issuance of over 30 appeals from the movement in the legislative elections.
However, Bouteflika has removed ministers close to him like Minister of Housing Abdelmaguid Taboun, Minister of Finance Murad Madlasi and ministers seconded at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Abdel-Aziz Ziari and al-Amin Kharbi. Former minister of justice Ahmed O'yehia, who is the secretary-general of the National Democratic Rally, has become a state minister and the president's personal representative, a special post likely to enable him to devote more time and effort to following up the dossier of the Western Desert, of which he has been in charge since 1991.
The National Democratic Rally has got six portfolios, while the representation of the Peace Society Movement has risen up to four portfolios, which means that the two parties will abrogate the decision of freezing their involvement in parliament.
"My sister lost her life because of the water crisis and those who were responsible for running that sector," said a desperate youth who had lost his sister. She was run over by a truck affiliated to Drinking Water Distribution Company in the Algerian capital.
Some people complain about the lack of water for almost a month sometimes.
As they realize how serious such a matter is, the government television news bulletins carry almost continuous reports about government "efforts" to solve the problem, as well as officials' statements to calm the inhabitants' fears promising them a solution to the crisis shortly.
Each time, people talk about the "Great River" project achieved by Libya starting from the Algerian southern borders through which it managed to put an end to the water problem in its northern cities even years ago.
Two days ago, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Abdel-Aziz Belkhadim tried in a press conference to understate reports of Libyan-Algerian differences as well as Algerian-Tunisian differences over the exploitation of those two countries of underground water resources on the joint borders.
The number of the rich worldwide has gone up be 200, 000 persons in the year 2001, hitting 7.1 million. Their total wealth amounted to $26.2 trillion, the equivalent of 29.4 trillion euros.

A confirmation by the U.S. Department of State on giving a series of warnings to Lebanon, Syria and Iran in the last few days under the cover of efforts to avert the opening of a "second front" comes in line with the Israeli campaign on Lebanon, accusing it of harbouring Al-Qaeda fighters, supported by Hezbollah, as well as on Syria, which received soft U.S. warnings in the U.N. Security Council, with brandishing the seventh chapter of the U.NN Charter to punish "those providing safe havens to terrorists", thus completing the shape of a scheme similar to that used by Sharon in launching his war on the Palestinians.
Sharon's maliciousness and his war supporters in the U.S. Administration confirm his ability to break out the situation in south Lebanon, accusing the Lebanese resistance group of taking the initiative. So, how come that the Americans are concerned with "good intentions" over the fate of the anticipated summer peace conference, if the situation on this front changes.
what actions have been taken to confront him?
The U.S. president did not ask much to achieve the Sharonite peace, but he said briefly:
Bush also attacked Iraq, Iran and Syria, calling for a final peace between Israel, and Lebanon and Syria. But, he said that Syria supports peace and fights terrorism. However, he considered Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah as terrorist groups. Supporting these movements, every Muslim Arab says that these movements were established to fight Israeli terrorism and will remain as long as this terrorism exists.
The speech reflects how much the U.S. Administration is compliant with all Arab visitors' requests, or the aggregate influence of Arab friends and allies on the U.S. Administration.

Abdel Bari Attwan wrote: It may be premature to talk about the American proposal for settlement of the Palestinian cause before President George Bush announces it officially, but what has been leaked to the media or said by Arab officials who visited Washington indicates that the American initiative will revolve mainly around the ideas of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.
It was interesting that Prince Saud Al Faisal expressed his extreme happiness with the results of his talks with the American President. It was also interesting that he talked about "full normalization" of relations with the Hebrew State and did not use the expression "normal relations" that the Arab League summit held in Beirut had inserted into the initiative of Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah, which later became the Arab initiative.
The proposals of President George Bush will not be acceptable at Palestinian and Arab levels, by which we mean peoples, not ruling regimes.
This is the first time in history that we hear about a "temporary state" that joins the United Nations and becomes a member of this organization without having a capital or recognized borders.

Some people complain about the lack of water for almost a month sometimes.
As they realize how serious such a matter is, the government television news bulletins carry almost continuous reports about government "efforts" to solve the problem, as well as officials' statements to calm the inhabitants' fears promising them a solution to the crisis shortly.
Each time, people talk about the "Great River" project achieved by Libya starting from the Algerian southern borders through which it managed to put an end to the water problem in its northern cities even years ago.
Two days ago, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Abdel-Aziz Belkhadim tried in a press conference to understate reports of Libyan-Algerian differences as well as Algerian-Tunisian differences over the exploitation of those two countries of underground water resources on the joint borders.

As the community enjoys the full support of an extremist American religious right that is adamant to enslave America's stupendous wealth to the realization of a Torah myth that claims the necessity of establishing an "Israeli state" before the Second Coming to rid the world of all its evils, it is prepared to commit a series of follies to expel Palestinian Arabs, expand Israeli territories and exercise full dominance. It is also intent on dragging America into the crisis, so that it may crush the bones of Arabs and Muslims.
I believe that the establishment of a broad political and institutional current that spans the whole political spectrum and embraces hundreds of non-governmental organizations in all Arab countries and millions of Arabs who look at their future with uncertainty, a current that will work for realizing the objective of applying persistent pressure in a peaceful manner that conforms to the norms of our contemporary age to score limited but cumulative victories that would eventually result in the establishment of the union(s), would be possible if it was sought by a group that works with conviction, organization, democracy and modern techniques.
-The Arab League is now in a position that allows it to serve as a nucleus for an organization resembling the European Commission and its union bodies.
FUEL OIL AND MISSILES
Colin Powell's recent tour in the Middle East had sent the situation in the Shebaa Farms front back to normal and it is no more secret that he told Damascus to necessarily control "Hezbollah" or Sharon would be let to take revenge.
The reverse reading of the series of fresh warnings supposes that Sharon seeks to extend his war in the north to guarantee the "destruction" of the conference first and foremost in spite of its weak goals, and blackmail Syria again through involving it in a corner called in Israel "double-dealing" to reassure the Americans of Israel's support for the U.S.-led war on terrorism and instigate Palestinian organizations like Islamic Jihad to launch attacks on Israelis.
BUSH SHATTERS SILENCE
Reform is a national Palestinian, not American, request and all Bush's demands were reasonable.
They can accept the results or claim that the Palestinians did not fulfil them and, thus, countdown for the provisional state is contingent upon the good intentions of the U.S. and Israel.
Finally, I can say that Bush's speech is war on Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims.
However, the provisional state is necessary and should be imposed with all possible means as the U.S. needs to "quieten" the atmosphere to attack Iraq, putting into consideration Pentagon hawks' promises given to Sharon that the circumstances will be appropriate for the hoped settlement later on.
In addition to the perils of quietening the atmosphere to attack Iraq and serious repercussions of a possible control on the Arab and Palestinian situation, other risks are related to the features of the final solution or freezing the issue for several years as the new prospective state will not be able to deal with its neighbour (Israel) apart from negotiations on the basis that the new "reforms" will grant it a chance to mull over another thing.
Regarding Syria and Lebanon, the perils lie in the perspective of isolation and threats, especially concerning the position of resistance forces.
Any other moves or negotiations on the part of Arabs will bring nothing but more pressure for Sharon's and Bush's appetite for subjugating the Palestinian and Arab position has become voracious.
He added that a programme had been prepared for extending aids to support the economic reform process and modernize the industrial sector in Egypt.

Another four courses were completed inside companies. Two hundred industrial companies offered to participate in programmes for developing exports, a figure expected to go up to 300 companies.
Three years have elapsed since the agreement of the Egyptian government with the European Union to finance an ambitious programme to modernize industry with a grant to the value of 250 million euros to be lent to industrial producers, 60 Egyptian companies operating in various industrial fields applied for taking part in the programme and the government announced the construction of some centres of information to serve the factories wishing to benefit by the programme. Nevertheless modernization has not started yet. Each time, the approach of the date of implementation is announced, various obstacles pop up to prevent it such as the expiry of the grant exploitation period. Painstaking negotiations, therefore, begin between the Egyptian and European parties to extend its validity for another three years ending in 2006.

SHENOUDA DEPOSES A WELL-KNOWN PREACHER DUE TO HIS RELATION WITH "NEW TESTAMENT" GROUP
The sources dated Michel's rebellion against the Church back to 1981 when that preacher, exploiting the dispute between late President Sadat and Pope Shenouda, instituted himself as patriarch during Pope Shenouda's deposition thus contravening the church laws and its leadership powers. The sources added that the Pope had forgiven him in the following years giving him more than one chance providing he would not run counter to the church laws again or adopt recalcitrant views. He, however, supported the defrocked group and adopted similar beliefs.
He has extensive activity in Mokattam and Heliopolis areas (Cairo) Last week, Shenouda had defrocked a monk and a deacon. Some nuns were also defrocked.
In its recent two terms, the People's Assembly saw several events and issues, which preoccupied the public opinion, with several male and female members of parliament, who had fixed positions on some laws, having emerged as stars. Among those female members were Dr. Gorget Sobhi, a Copt, who is a member of the People's Assembly Legislative Committee. She was once given a round of applause from other members for defending the Islamic Shari'ah against other opinions. Sobhi used to get involved in debates and discussions between People's Assembly Speaker Fatehi Sorour and MP Adel Eid. Afaq Arabia makes an interview with her, asking about her assessment of the People's Assembly's legislative and supervisory performance, female members' role, her concurrence with the Muslim Brotherhood members and liquor issue as well as other issues.
Sobhi: Not all members abide by the party commitment for it is a relative question. Members are not infallible. For example, I may differ with other members about the party commitment. There is no contradiction with the party commitment as long as I do not violate the general framework, consider the people's interests and respect the constitution and law. Q: But, some see that what you are doing is a role drawn up by the party?
Sobhi: They are mostly objective and their way of discussion is very good. I highly spoke of Dr. Mohamed Morsi when he affirmed in his request for information on Al-Azhar that Al-Azhar is an august edifice which concerns all Egyptians, which is a highly elevated phrase for all of us are related to these sanctuaries, be they Muslim or Christian.
Question: What is the secret of Sorour saying that you are the member no 18 in the group (the Muslim Brotherhood which has 17 members in parliament)?
Sobhi: What made me intervene in the issue is that Dr. Zeinab justified the request for the presence of Christians in Egypt and that wine is allowed by Christianity. When I had the floor, I said this runs counter to both Islam and Christianity, making it clear that both Muslims and Christians are not given access to gambling halls. Only those who have foreign passports, whether Muslims or Christians, can go to these halls, so it is indecent to say that wine and gambling halls should be permitted out of hospitality and that the law should allow them as there are Christians in the country.
Moreover, this opinion cannot stand the fact that the change of the Islamic Group means that it will come out of the camp of the Islamic violent movements to the camp of the Islamic political ones, in whose center the Muslim Brotherhood Group has been occupying since its establishment. Thus, the two Groups may share many issues and views, in the medium and long run, but the Ikhwan will be boosted with its wide experience in political and popular action.
Most probably, by so doing the State is continuing its political strategy, translated by the security men into precluding the officially banned Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan) Group from having an effective political existence, and placing it in a defensive position. This strategy has been put regularly into effect since December 1994.
Most probably, the opening of the Islamic Group file at present is a response to reasons related to the current security conditions, not to the future political conditions; i.e. what is raised now by the State is the security, not political, file of the Islamic Group.
Those "security-important" papers include the release of Islamic Group's members, against whom there are judicial rulings, from Egyptian courts. None of the convicted members is expected to be released before the elapse of the imprisonment term. However, those who are imprisoned according to the emergency law and without judicial rulings may be released in batches.
In the same context, it seems that the media propaganda for the Group's relinquishment of violence has raised an additional security subject to the State's concern related to the raised reservations about the form of media performance of some Group leaders and members whether inside or outside Egypt.

There are export problems between Egypt and Jordan mainly including the high price and low quality of Egyptian commodities, hence the inability to compete with similar commodities coming from other countries to Jordan. despite the approximate location and low transport cost, There are dumping cases against Jordan's imports of some food commodities from several countries, which impacts on the Egyptian companies that export these commodities.
In this regard, Egyptian Prime Minister Atef Ebeid received a report from Minister of Trade Youssef Boutros on his recent visit to Damascus.
A number of Palestinians headed by Bassam Abu-Sherif, adviser to the Palestinian President Yasser Arafat started to form a secular political party to run the Palestinian legislative elections scheduled for next January.
Abu-Sherif wondered how we denounce Palestinian civilians being targeted by the Israeli government and army while we do not denounce Palestinian operations against the Israeli civilians. He affirmed that the Palestinian resistance movements, which carried out operations against Israeli civilians, caused great damage to the Palestinian cause and gave priceless help to Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to implement his schemes against the Palestinian people.
SIGNIFICANT BREAKTHROUGH IN SUDAN PEACE NEGOTIATIONS: AGREEMENT ON SHARIA & SELF-DETERMINATION OF THE SOUTH
Negotiators still have to go through strenuous negotiations scheduled to start on 12th of next month and will last for five weeks. These negotiations tackle disputable issues, especially absorption of the rebel leaders in the government, division of oil revenues, ceasefire, security arrangements and the future of fighters.
Thanks to mediators' efforts, a solution to the issue of self-determination has been reached through a six-year compromise between the government who suggested a ten-year transitional period and the rebels who suggested a two years one.
The agreed text will be applicable to the central administration of the country in which the peoples of the south and north participate.
In relation to the self-determination right, a referendum will decide on separation or unity, he said, regarding the Machakos protocol as a significant step in the direction of peace. The issues uninvolved in the agreement, including a transitional government, are thorny and complicated, the spokesman said.
Faruk Abu Issa, a member of the leadership of the opposition Grouping Party, mordantly rapped the Machakos protocol signed between the government and the SPLA led by John Garang. This agreement will lead to a partial transitional solution, but will not bring the hoped for stability in Sudan, neither will it put an end to the ongoing wars in east and south Sudan, he said.
The source added that Qusai, who headed the delegation that held military and security talks with the senior commanders of the Revolutionary Guard and the Ministry of Defence at Sad Abad complex, one of the late Shah's palaces where heads of state stay during their visits to Iran. He was, therefore, transported from the border area to the city of Karaminshah (west) and then was carried by a military plane to Mahrabad airbase near Tehran.
U.S. COMPLETES MILITARY FACILITIES IN KUWAIT IN A PRELUDE TO STRIKING IRAQ
The U.S. has actual military presence in the Gulf waters and all the six Arab Gulf countries in addition to another non-Arab country, Turkey neighbouring Iraq in the north.
Al-Sheikh Gaber said the Americans use the leased Doha camp at present, while the new camp belongs to the Kuwaiti army and will be allocated for U.S. Forces.
The U.S. forces use Doha camp situated on the outskirts of Kuwait city as a base for soldiers and heavy equipment.
PENTAGON MILIEUS AND CONSERVATIVES PRESENT PRINCE HASAN AS A STRONG CANDIDATE FOR LEADING POST-SADDAM IRAQ
The participation of Prince Hasan in the Iraqi opposition officers conference had created a sensation in Arab and British circles. Although the conference where former generals in Iraqi army discussed the future of a post-Saddam Iraq and the role of the military in it was over and issued its resolutions, the relations of the Hashemites with the Iraqi throne and the talk of their return have not stopped.
In that axis, Western commentators said that Prince Hasan tried to improve his image in the eyes of the Americans and prove that he was better than his nephew.
These arrangements, covering another two provinces, are being made with American back-up in the context of bilateral cooperation.
The U.S. has been showing increasing significance to Djibouti since the September 11 attacks thanks to its strategic position between the African continent and the Arab Peninsula at the entrance of the Red Sea.
Different Islamic blocs in the Kuwaiti Parliament started their election preparations due to the nearing date of parliamentary elections in Kuwait. It is officially scheduled that the fifth complementary parliamentary session will be completed next June. In this regard, reports are circulated to the effect that the date of elections could possibly be put forward to avoid holding them in the summer taking into account the high temperature in Kuwait at that time. This matter may prevent the candidates election campaigns, which include symposia and rallies from being conducted at opportune times particularly after the experience of the summer elections in June 1999 when the Kuwaiti Parliament was constitutionally dissolved due to a government protest against what it described as parliamentary arbitrariness in using the right to question ministers.
Different parliamentary sources said that liberal and government parties agreed on common action at the end of the summer holiday that seeks to bring the issue of granting women political rights up to the parliament. They pointed out that the women rights supporters got a government promise to strongly support this tendency. They now feel that the executive power is more credible at that time more than any other time.
He said that the constitutional movement welcomed his call, but he noticed that the Salafi popular rally neither accepted nor refused his call.
Commenting on the recent visit of the U.S. Undersecretary of Defence, Paul Wolfowitz, to Turkey and his consultations regarding the situation in Iraq, Al-Ahram Al-Arabi published the following analysis:
Second; Ankara does not feel at ease concerning American contacts with Iraqi Kurdish groups. These contacts included talks about a federal state in Iraq, comprising a Kurdish entity in the north whose capital is Kirkuk.
Third; Ankara stressed the necessity not to ignore about one million Turkmen of Turkish origins who live in north Iraq at a percentage of one to three. It also warned against the seriousness of Kurdish groups' ignorance of the rights and ambitions of those Turkmen, whom Ankara views as suffering from racial discrimination pracitised against them by Iraq's Kurds.
IRAN IS WAITING FOR DEATH GAME IN IRAQ Under this headline, Talib Al-Ahmed from Tehran, wrote an article, some excerpts of which run to the following effect:
The second option rejects all kinds of cooperation with American schemes on Iraq's future. It thinks that if anything of the sort took place, the credibility of the Islamic Republic in the Islamic World would suffer negative impacts.
The third option calls for Iran taking a neutral attitude towards what would take place on the Iraqi theatre of events when the expected American campaign against Iraq starts just as it had done at the outbreak of the Desert Storm in 1991.
Political Advisor to President Mubarak Dr Osam Al-Baz criticised pro-Israel American position, indicating that the U.S. helped Israel continue with perpetrating war crimes against the Palestinians when it justified such crimes as "self-defence."
Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) said that its leader Dr. John Garang had conducted a "primary evaluation" with the Egyptian leadership over Machakos Protocol which the SPLM had signed with the Sudanese government. Garang also received a message from Libyan leader Mu'ammar Gaddafi supporting the protocol.
Erman declined to uncover the details of the discussions held with Cairo. However, observers made it probable that Cairo has informed Garang of its fears and concern over the self-determination of South Sudan that was stated in Machakos Protocol, which was signed between the SPLM and Khartoum late last month.
MINISTER OF IRRIGATION: THE HIGH DAM LAKE WATER STOCKS MEET THE NEEDS OF EGYPT AND SUDAN
He pointed out that the Irrigation Ministry was making periodic predictions about flood features and referring them regularly to the Nile Input Committee which controls the water output and levels.
A few days after the Egyptian Supreme Court-Martial had issued its rulings in the case known as the Muslim Brotherhood Group (Ikwan) "professors" organisation, which included 16 leading figures, Asharq Al-Awsat learnt that the Group had addressed its deputies in the People's Assembly (the 17-member group) to launch a parliamentary campaign calling for cancelling courts-martial for fear that another number of its members might be court-martialled.
The Ikhwanite efforts come at a time when court-martial rulings have been issued against some 115 of its members since 1995. They have been included in 4 cases, two of which were in 1995 and 1996 in which 82 members were involved; a case in 1999 in which rulings were issued against 15 members while the latest of which included 16 members.
Dr Al Hifnawi pointed out that Egypt has actual potential for producing silicon chips used for cell production. One ton of pure crystal silicon costs $100 thousand, whereas Egypt has pure and extremely pure quartz (99.9%) or white sand as well as charcoal resulting from citrus trees Dr Al Hifnawi pointed out that the productive solar cell operates efficiently, thus creating opportunities for solar cell laboratory production in Egypt provided that silicon and chemical chips as well as the materials required for manufacture and the capsule are available.
An official source forecast that Egypt would positively respond to the Turkish request but with preconditions as Cairo did not see any concrete steps in Ankara regarding the implementation of the 1996 agreement, whereby Turkey was supposed to buy 10 billion cubic meters of gas worth 4 billion U.S. dollars, part of which would be used to answer the country's gas needs, with the larger part to be re-exported to European markets through Turkey. It was agreed that the deal would be implemented by two Turkish and Egyptian companies, but no schedule was set, thus rendering the agreement unbinding.
The non-implementation of the Egyptian-Turkish gas agreement may lead to a U.S. intervention to push the deal forward as the U.S. strongly supports any regional cooperation, to which an Arab country is party. As long as Egyptian-Israeli cooperation in the field was unsuccessful and Tel Aviv went out of the the MEDOR project last March under pressure from public opinion and in light of public interest, Washington will seek to bring views closer between Cairo and Ankara (America's key ally in the region) through supporting U.S., and other oil companies operating in the region to step up the construction of the regional gas pipeline to transport Egyptian natural gas to Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey, focussing on involving Israel in the deal even if later on. It is well-known that U.S. oil company investments have exceeded the 22 billion U.S. dollar mark since the late 1970s till now, expectedly to rise up to 35 billion U.S. dollars by 2010.
Abul-Komsan's statements came as a comment on reports that the issue of customs tariff on clothing items was on the agenda of WTO's committee on penetrating markets, which would hold its meetings during the period from September 11th to 13th next.
At an earlier time, European Union (EU) ambassador told Al-Alam Al-Youm that in case the discussions between the European Commission and Egypt ended without a compromise, then it is strongly expected that a case would be filed against Egypt with the WTO on the structure of the customs tariff adopted in January last.
EXCHANGE DIVISION WARNS AGAINST DOLLAR EXCEEDING LE5
Al-Abiadh attributed the dollar exchange rate rise to a number of reasons, foremost of which is the high demand for the dollar by merchants and importers who can not get it from banks. Hence they resort to unofficial channels. The reasons behind this increase also include the deteriorating condition in exchange firms and the government failure to meet companies' demands for dollar. This led to an atmosphere that is hard to define as some companies were closed down due to violating the agreed on provisions while others failed to cope with the market.
The second has to do with the lack of transparency, credibility and confidence between all parties.
The division had sent a memorandum to Prime Minister, Atef Ebeid showing companies' losses during the period from last January till now.
IT IS THE AGE OF "CITIBANK" INDEED!
Another sign of the infatuation with the Citibank school can be seen in the selection of Wagdi Rabat (son of that school), who was staying at home then too, as President of Misr Exterior Bank to succeed Abdullah Tayel. Fears that the domination of such a school would go beyond all limits have led to predictions on the part of the personnel that an administrative manager in charge of the cars of the bank would also be chosen from Citibank to take over after the administrative manager, a former police major general had been run over by a truck. Rabat has chosen his first assistant from Citibank, Moustafa Aboul-Fotouh; inspection department general manager, Hosni Al-Sidi from Chase Manhattan. Many people would look to Citibank for filling in for any officials whose positions fall vacant in the belief that it is a highly recommended one and that appointing its associates would win the favor of the circles of the government as well as other bodies.
According to bankers and economists, Ebeid's choice of Citibank and Chase Manhattan officials for public banks posts is political rather than technical.
The source said that 98.5% of those debts are due to National Investment Bank, as well as the four public sector banks especially Banque Misr and the Bank of Alexandria. He pointed out that Banque Misr had agreed to settle LE1.5 billion as due debts on spinning and weaving companies, but those companies, having benefited by the settlement advantages including waiving part of the debts, started defaulting once again.
In exclusive statements to Al-Ahrar newspaper the minister pointed out that such a sum represented 31.4% of the sold companies proceeds, already received by the ministry from buyers.
The report pointed out that balance of services dropped by 45.1% as an outcome of the retreat in both investment and tourism proceeds by 61.6% and 22.3% respectively, compared to the first quarter of last year, 2001.
665 INVESTMENT COMPANIES MADE EXPANSIONS AND PUMPED 11 BILLION POUNDS
The increase in such companies' capital which hit about 11 billion pounds does not include the capital of the new companies which have been just set up, but it is exclusively related to the companies that have already operated, he said. The legislative amendments that aimed at giving the expansions carried out by such companies 5-year tax holidays together with the constant development in the Egyptian investment climate contributed to encouraging such companies to expand their activities in Egypt and inject fresh money, he added.
An office for approvals was inaugurated in cooperation with the Ministry of Foreign Trade to spare Damietta merchants the effort of travelling to Cairo to complete the necessary procedures of furniture exportation, he pointed out.
Meanwhile, board chairman of the Holding Company for Airports and Aviation, Ibrahim Mannaa unveiled that an economic feasibility study is being prepared to exploit 50 feddans of the lands owned by Cairo International Airport with a view to setting up hotels, a tourist market, swimming pools and recreational means serving the population of Cairo and other governorates.
In the meantime, an official with Centra Technology, the company in charge of carrying out the project, rejected charging his company with monopolizing the market. 150 companies refused to contribute to Centra capital when established, he said.
On the other hand, head of the Computer Division with the Chambers of Commerce General Federation Khalil Hassan Khalil stated that the negative impacts resulting from establishing Centra Technology company-monopolizing computer assembling market in Egypt and escape of 4400 companies working in the same field- were mooted in the division's first meeting.
The agreement stipulates that the ownership of "SCIB" company for paints fully owned by UPC be changed to be as follows: 60% to Indian "Asian Paints", 25% to individual shareholders with the UPC and 15% to OCI.
Within a few days' time a number of fresh investment projects will be implemented in the industrial zone in central Sinai with joint Egyptian foreign investments to the tune of LE100 million, said Dr. Hassan Ratteb, head of Sinai Investors Society and member of the Supreme Committee on the National Project of Sinai Development, adding that that step came within the framework of the national plan for developing Sinai and turning it into investment and development attracting zones.
The Exports & Imports Nasr Company concluded a contract with a public enterprise sector company under which cement valued at $7.5 million and one hundred tons of rice to the tune of 260 thousand dollars would be exported to Sudan.
During his visit two days ago to Burg Al-Arab Industrial City (West of Alexandria) Premier Atef Ebeid said that the government approved the idea of reconsidering interest rates in a balanced way in favour of investment development. He warned against pausing for too long before the issue of investors and the banking system. He added that the state was bent on letting each party get its right and encouraging investment all over the country.
1.9 MILLION TONS OF POTATO PRODUCTION, PLAN FOR INCREASING EXPORTS
Thanks to the introduction of advanced technology to agricultural activities and depending on biological control, a quantum leap has been achieved in yield productivity as the production per feddan reached 10.3 tons while it hiked to 15.39 tons per feddan in some areas, said Abd El-Razeq Hassan, head of Economic Affaires Sector at the Ministry of Agriculture Hassan added that the final estimates of potato crop with its three rotations showed that the new arable lands have effectively participated for the first time in the yield production as the potato cultivated area hit 21 thousand feddans, around 10.80% of Egypt's cultivated land. Meanwhile, production per feddan hit 10.44 tons and the total production hit 214 thousand tons, representing 11.25% of the total agricultural production nationwide, Hassan added .
On the other hand, long-staple cotton' sales reached 60,123 tons, or 58% of total sales, up 43,999 tons or 37%.
SPECIAL LOUNGE AT CAIRO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT FOR BUSINESSMEN
TO GRANT CE MARK TO EGYPTIAN EXPORTS
He pointed out that there are no bodies outside Europe to grant such a certificate, but an authorization to grant it can be given to any authority that meets the conditions provided for in the European market agreement.
TRADE EXCHANGE WITH EU DOWN
EGYPTIAN-KOREAN BUSINESS COUNCIL CONSIDERS BOOSTING ECONOMIC RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES
They pointed to the importance of the visit paid by President Mubarak to Korea in 1999, which mainly resulted in broadening the spectrum of economic cooperation between the two countries.
COMMERCIAL TALKS FOR BOOSTING INTEGRATION BETWEEN EGYPT, JORDAN, LEBANON, AND SYRIA
The source said that yarn projects at a cost of some 400 million dollars would be soon offered for the countries mentioned to be executed in light of politically desired and backed rapprochement to form Arab blocs that would control dealing with Europe and America after the recent problems and the temporary suspension of Arab importation operations after the 11 September events in the US.
The lists accompanying the agreement between Egypt and Lebanon must be reconsidered to be made use of in a way that would fit the clauses of the agreement on streamlining and developing trade exchange between the Arab countries. The Lebanese side should emphasise the application of the preferential importation principle to the bids announced in both countries.
BASSAM ABU-SHERIF FORMS NEW PARTY TO SQUARE UP TO ISLAMIC MOVEMENTS
Abu-Sherif stressed that the Palestinian democratic party would square up to the extremist Palestinian movements whose role grows on the Palestinian street at a time when the party abides by resisting occupation by all available means until all Israeli soldiers leave the Palestinian territories occupied in 1967. The party rejects and denounces any action done by any Palestinian against Israeli civilians.
Abu-Sherif pointed out that the party, due to be shortly announced, would elect its leaderships and would work for establishing free market economy, achieving transparency in Palestinian institutions, separating powers, spreading awareness among citizens of the concept of democracy, and supporting civil society institutions.
The two sides made significant concessions in two key issues in the negotiations: the relation between state and religion and self-determination for the people of south Sudan.
Well-informed sources affirmed that the American mediators who attended the negotiations along with other Western mediators for the first time, played a big role in exerting pressure on the two sides, leading to reaching the protocol which represented a framework agreement on which the coming round will be based.
The settlement had been achieved in this thorny file, which constitues a stumbling block facing 18 rounds of negotiations between the two parties that were doomed to failure, thus reaching a formula giving the people of the south the right to approve its laws, which means sparing them - practically - the enforcement of sharia. Northern provinces were also given a similar right to accept seeking decisions from sharia.
Regarding the federal entity, a constitutional formula is expected to be reached to abrogate the 1998 constitution and guarantee the final agreement, thus resolving the religion-state issue, Erman added.
Meanwhile, Bashir's advisor for peace affairs Ghazi Salah Eddin regarded that the Machakos protocol is beneficial to the Sudanese people and those who participated in peace efforts. The biggest gain of the Machakos is represented in emphasizing the Shari'a and Sudan's unity, he said, adding that other issues can be resolved easily.
Sources with President Mohamed Khatemi's government contacted by Asharq Al Awsat denied such reports or any knowledge of such a visit. The trustworthy source who is close to the Revolutionary Guard, however, confirmed that the Iranian President and his aides knew nothing about the visit which was secretly paid.
He also raised the question of the Iraqi military and civilian planes that escaped to Iran at the beginning of the second Gulf War 1991. Qusai also told the Iranians that his government was ready to pay half the price of each plane in cash.
Work included facilities in Qatar and Kuwait.
Washington has replenished its military stock in the region from which it had withdrawn for use in its war in Afghanistan.
The U.S. has military aircraft and ground troops in Kuwait in order that they represent a deterrent to Iraq since Washington led an international alliance in the Gulf war in 1991, which ended in driving the Iraqi forces out of Kuwait following a 7-month occupation.
Some Arab countries fear counter impacts in the Arab world in case of launching a military action for toppling Saddam Hussein, especially in light of rancour dominating the Arab world due to the U.S. blind support of Israel in its war against the Palestinian Authority.
Some believe that the Prince's involvement in the Iraqi issue might help reduce tension between the American Department of State which still objects to military action and the Pentagon that urges a military and speedy action.
The second axis is focussed on what some analysts called rivalry between king Abdullah II and his uncle Prince Hasan.
Informed sources laid bare that Yemeni-U.S. arrangements are currently underway to establish control centers at some Yemeni outlets to be connected with an online network and cameras in Shaboah Province, and deploy an anti-terror special force at security centers in the province, which is believed to harbour extremists.
U.S. military experts feel more reassured in Djibouti among thousands of French soldiers than in Yemen.
EARLY ALLIANCES FOR KUWAITI PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS
He denied reports to the effect that the bill was withdrawn.
It is to be mentioned that this movement was a trend that dissented from the traditional Salafi movement. Moreover, the Islamic constitutional movement is considered the nearest to the line of the Muslim Brotherhood.
TURKEY AND SADDAM'S PRICE
First; Turkey would like Washington to review its stance and give up plans to overthrow Saddam by military force as this would be too costly and Turkey will have to bear a considerable share in case it participates in the attack.
Washington has responded to Barazani's wish and intervention, Ankara expressed annoyance towards such behaviour, considering what happened as an indication of the serious problems it may constitute in the future on the part of Iraqi Kurds, whom Turkey does not trust. Those Kurds, according to Turkey, could arouse disturbances inside its territories and revive the Kurdish dream of a state bringing them together. Even if this may be confined to wishful thinking, no one could guarantee its prospective outcomes for Turkey.
Secondly, pumping billions of dollars into the Turkish public budget with a view to saving the country from the economic collapse threatening it.
Within this framework, observers have interpreted the recent indication made by head of the Expediency Council, Hashimi Rafasangani. They said that cooperation with Washington at the beginning of the operation of toppling the Taliban government in Afghanistan was tantamount to a coded message suggesting to the Americans that the same thing can happen in the Iraqi problem settlement.
In this context, an Iranian parliamentary source told Al-Ahram Al-Arabi that Tehran had received several American messages through intermediaries calling on it to coordinate positions regarding the scheme of toppling Saddam Hussein. According to the same source, Tehran had not replied favourably to those messages pointing out that the government of President Khatami was dealing very cautiously with American invitations and schemes.
AL-BAZ: EGYPT REJECTS PNA BEING REFORMED BY ANY OUTSIDERS
GARANG CONTACTED EGYPTIAN OFFICIALS TO ESTIMATE MACHAKOS PROTOCOL
He added that Garang was talking to the Egyptian leadership from his headquarters in the liberated territories, South Sudan.
Garang also made phone contacts with the Nigerian and South African leaderships that expressed full support of just peace and shift to democracy in Sudan.
He pointed out that Egypt had succeeded in providing 750 million cubic metres of last year flood water and keeping it in the High Dam Lake for times of need.
IKHWAN SEEK TO HAVE COURTS-MARTIAL CANCELLED
They were neither released nor tried up till now. Through this attempt, the Group seeks to have the emergency law dropped and the court-martial trials cancelled in order to have the support of other popular brackets and human rights organisations, hoping to have more popular and mass media support. Even if such efforts were a fiasco they would prove that the Ikhawnite deputies in the parliament are not only representing the Muslim Brotherhood but also all the people's brackets especially as the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights has issued a statement in support of the Ikhwanite figures against the court-martial rulings issued against them.
Egyptian official sources told Asharq Al-Awsat that it had been decided to hold an extensive meeting comprising high-ranking military experts from Egypt, Israel, USA and the UN peace-keeping forces during the coming few weeks with a view to holding more talks over the US request to reduce the size of its peace-keeping forces in Sinai.
On July 30th, a great difference cropped up between Egypt and Sudan over the Machakos Protocol signed between Khartoum and the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) which provides for holding a referendum in South Sudan to choose between unity or separation. Sudanese Vice-President Ali Othman Taha left Cairo after a 3-day visit without meeting President Hosni Mubarak as it was expected.
They pointed out a probable Egyptian-Sudanese summit to be held soon. Yesterday (July 30th) Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher said a Sudanese envoy would reach Cairo soon to make explanations because Cairo had incomplete information. He pointed out that Egypt had received some pieces of information from Kenyan and American sources and little information from Sudanese sources, declining to comment on the agreement so long as no sufficient information was available for Egypt.
Meanwhile, the 16 defendants linked between being indicted and the American campaign against terrorism, regarding the whole case as mere settling of political differences between the Government and the Group. They issued a statement in which they denied any connection with terrorism and violence. They said that they were taken aback by being accused of baseless accusations. "We call for activating the constitution rather than obstructing it especially as it stipulates that Islam is the official religion of the State and that the Islamic Law (Sharia) is the basic source of legislation.
He emphasised that the Ikhwan would keep on proclaiming their call through peaceful methods and good counsel, regarding the participation in the parliamentary and syndical elections as well as performing public action publicly as a matter the Group would not backtrack on even if it is exposed to abortive blows.
The sitting of July 28 witnessed a precedent considered the first of its kind in the history of courts-martial in Egypt. Defendant no.10, Ahmed Mustafa has been given access to contracting his marriage in the court hall amid mixed feelings of sadness about being accused in the case and happiness about getting married.
Yesterday, the court held its hearing amidst strict security procedures in a military barracks at the Hykestep neighbourhood, east Cairo.
The whereases said that the convicted "had acted anew to revive the activity of that group through Ikhwanite secret promotion action in districts, specific and particular committees in Greater Cairo sector with a view to the recruitment of new elements for the Group. They tampered with the thought of youth and simpletons through their beliefs. Their secret activities also extended to charities to exploit their funds and members for serving the purposes of the group. They have also set promotion and Ikhwanite programmes, as well as training and rehabilitation schemes for the group members and went on jihad (struggle) tours and held Ikhwanite occasions.
The implementation of the plan that aims at exporting 3 billion cubic metres of Egyptian natural gas to Israel is still on the cards once the violence in the region stopped, said an economic report issued by the American embassy in Cairo.
PALESTINIANS SUSTAIN 10 BILLION U.S. DOLLARS IN LOSSES DUE TO ISRAELI AGGRESSIONS
MESH'AL DENOUNCES PALESTINIAN DELEGATION PARTICIPATING IN TALKS IN WASHINGTON TO END INTIFADA
Striking Iraq is more dangerous than Arab rulers could imagine, he emphasised, adding that in case Iraq was struck and occupied all Arab countries without exception would lose.
Libyan Leader Mu'ammar Gaddafi cautioned against what he termed as signs of a serious water crisis that could devastate the Middle East region. He referred to risks facing the Arab nation due to this serious crisis and Zionist bids to control Arab water sources, threatening violent nuclear attacks. The Zionists themselves say that the reason for possessing a nuclear bomb is to use it in reversing the watercourse of Arab rivers when necessary.
Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood Group rejected the position of the tripartite group including Jordanian Foreign Minister Marwan Al-Mashar; Saudi Foreign Minister, So'oud Al-Faysal and Egyptian Foreign Minister, Ahmed Maher regarding the security arrangements in the Palestinian territories, which had crystallized on the margin of the international quadrilateral committee in New York mid this month.
SUDAN'S DEBTS TO BE DROPPED, NORTH TO GET AID TO BUTTRESS PEACE PROCESS: BRITISH SOURCES
Meanwhile, the sources expressed its satisfaction with necessarily providing aid to north Sudan in a bid to fix a lasting peace on the country.
In what is regarded as a silent crisis between Cairo and Khartoum, Sudanese Vice-President Ali Othman Taha on Tuesday left Cairo for home after a 3-day visit without meeting with President Hosni Mubarak.
There are three reasons for signing the peace agreement with the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA): oil finds and emergence of significant economic interests to the U.S. in this field; all dialogues between northerners and southerners showed that peace in Sudan requires self-determination in South Sudan; and international powers, especially the U.S., decided to establish peace in Sudan, Taha said.
If matters are so, we are, then, approaching a very serious war. It will be the "mother of battles" not because of the military confrontations, but because of their repercussions. This means that all should tighten their belts well in preparation for the air pockets of the coming storm.
If war is possible, the region's countries should declare a supreme emergency state. Here, I mean the humanitarian side, which requires taking care for millions of people who may come out in human waves that will be difficult for any country to stop at the borders.
Iraq is the Arab party that is prepared for the war, at the media level at least. Reports had it that it was preparing for launching a propaganda war to defend its stances and embarrass the Arab parties, which would contribute to the American attacks against it. By so doing, Iraq believes that popular pressure will intimidate the Arab regimes and make the American government shorten its operations and targets.
AL-QAEDA SOURCES: BIN LADEN TO APPEAR ON VIDEO AFTER AN OPERATION IN AUGUST
"The preparations have been made, and yet to remain is the implementation," the sources said.
This information, obtained by Asharq Al-Awsat via the Internet, came through the sources' response to a question whether Bin Laden is dead or alive and another one about the soundness of reports that he would appear soon on a recorded video tape.
IMPUDENCE: AMERICAN AID SHIFTED FROM JUSTICE MINISTRY TO BAR ASSOCIATION
The decision received by USAID bureau in Cairo contained shifting the assistance from the Ministry of Justice to other organizations and agencies which Washington saw as concerned with expanding the democratic margin in Egypt especially the Egyptian Bar Association with which, as the USAID bureau sources alleged, negotiations had already been held to get financial aid and grants to develop their headquarters and provide them with computer sets as well as training their members in dealing with those computers.
Unprecedentedly, an Egyptian lady submitted a request to the Shura Council's Committee on Political Parties to establish a new political party she named Al-Mo'tamar Al-Democrati (Democratic Congress) Party.
On the other hand, the Administrative Court's Political Parties Bench has set early next month as a date for considering the petition filed by the co-founders of Mubarak Al-Nahdah (Mubarak Renaissance) Party, Sharia Party and Egyptian Gamahir (Masses) Party against the Committee on Political Parties which turned down their requests.
Whether these agencies wanted to settle personal scores with Saad Eddin Ibrahim or sent a message to other oppositionists, they made miscalculations and pushed the regime to the brink of a crisis.
There is a paradox that makes this role cancel itself because if Egypt maintained its loyalty to America and honoured its promises to support Israeli security, America will fail to find a justification for taking notice of what it does.
But, Washington's reading of the events was completely contrary to that.
Although they agree with the Arab regimes that a democratic shift may lead to the accession of Islamists to power, there is now an insistence on spreading democratic values in the Muslim world.
This blind alley taken by the regime will push it to the brink of abyss due to the leaders' deafness and wise people' silence. An unexpected clash with America may be the last nail in the coffin of a regime that became self-conceited because it managed to muzzle people and keep organized opposition and civil society establishments away.
If the regime does not carry out this review as soon as possible, others are ready to do it on their behalf.
Some 29 defendants, including five lawyers, will be tried in the first trial next Monday, 31 accused, including a lawyer, will be put on trial on the following day, while the rest will appear in a judicial bench in Alexandria Misdemeanour Court (Al-Raml district) next Wednesday.
According to the prosecution plea in the three cases, the defendants will face a 7-year sentence, if they are proven guilty. They are accused of gathering with over 5 people in a rally that could endanger the public order, damaging public and private property and assaulting policemen using force.
Over 25 percent of the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) members brandished resignation in retaliation for removing them from leading posts in the NDP.
They termed their removal from leading posts as a bid to undermine their popularity as a prelude to barring them from candidature in the NDP list in the 2005 vote.
A high level Russian diplomat expected that Iraqi foreign minister Nagi Sabri's visit to Moscow would achieve a "qualitative move" as Russia would obtain Baghdad's approval of the package it had proposed, which stipulated the return of international inspectors to Iraq in return for the suspension of the sanctions that would be lifted at a later time.
He added that it was not necessary for Baghdad's approval to receive a positive American response but it would force Washington to resort to the Security Council, thus giving Russia and the other countries opposed to the war a significant opportunity to object to the USA inclination and would delay or hinder if not prevent the war.
One of the participants in the symposium called upon Kuwait to foster an initiative on the popular level to consolidate with the Iraqi people, saying that Kuwait, within the GCC system, is the most efficient and the country most capable of setting a strategic development plan to integrate with Iraq.
They see that once they cross the Egyptian border to spend their vacations they will be secure and away from the Palestinian martyrdom operations and Intifada.
On the other hand, the number of Egyptians who used to visit Israel whether for work, tourism, trade or investment has witnessed a sharp decline since the beginning of the Aqsa Intifada in September, 2000.
Two days ago, Jordanian politician and oppositionist, Leith Shpeilat exploded a political surprise in his interview with Jordanian newspaper, "Shehan." He uncovered that Qatari Foreign Minister, Sheikh Hamad Bin Jasim Al-Than had told him that in order that Qatar may hold its own against Saudi Arabia it had only to open up to the Zionists.
Shpeilat criticized Qatar for agreeing to use the card played by the USA against Saudi Arabia, which refused to let its lands be used for striking Iraq.
Saddam's most prominent foes in the Gulf region announced their opposition to the American strike and interference to change the existing regime. These countries include Iran and Saudi Arabia which finally agreed to declare a unified stand rejecting the escalation policy and brandishing military force adopted by Washington against Iraq.
From the viewpoint of the Iranian Islamic Republic, American military interference in Iraq represents a grave threat to the national security as it will complete the siege ring laid on it, in addition to its implications including the annexation of Iraq to the other neighbouring countries where there are American military bases. Thus Iraq will be classified regionally as an ally to Washington.
Although no one in Iran will shed a single tear for the departure of Saddam Hussein, in case this takes place, the vague picture of the alternative makes Iraqi President remaining in power the less harmful option, even in light of lack of confidence in him, especially that he is no longer as strong as he was in the 1980s. This does not mean that Iranian decision-making circles are unanimous to adopt this option.
The signs of this started to show up with hints about reviving the Hashemite Union and Baghdad, Amman and Ankara Axis. This constitutes a serious threat to the position of Saudi Arabia and its permanent ambition to play the role of the regional, major, leading country of the Muslim world. Moreover, there are the sectarian considerations that have something to do with the Shiite majority's role in the future of Iraq when any change happens in Baghdad, something that will naturally arise the Saudi concern.
The "power-sharing protocol" in the Sudan which was put forward by mediators from the Inter-governmental Authority for Development in east Africa (IGAD) and which is currently discussed by the negotiators of the Sudanese government and the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) in Machakos, Kenya, stipulated limiting to a great extent the current competence of President Omar Al-Bashir and appointment of the SPLA leader John Garang as his vice-president in a way that makes him participate in the presidency and veto the president's decisions.
The project makes it incumbent upon the president to get the approval of his deputy to endorse all the appointments of the state posts including ministers, ambassadors, governors, judges, declaring and lifting the state of emergency and calling on the parliament to convene and suspend it.
According to the project, the legislative authority in Sudan will consist of two councils: the National Council and the Provinces Council.
In its final statement, the conference of National Charter in Syria held in London under the slogan "Syria For All Its Sons" in the period from August 23rd to 25th on an invitation from the Muslim Brotherhood group in Syria emphasized the necessity of laying down a "genuine national project" for combatting corruption. It demanded the adoption of a national plan to liberate the occupied Golan.
It added, "The signatories see seeking the support of foreigners against one's home as an entity, institutions or citizens as a red- line which can be approached only by a person without dignity or self-respect. No matter how sharp our internal differences may be, they ought not to tempt any party to ignore the truth of national affiliation which is deeply rooted in history and which vastly extends into the future.
The "Introduction" said, "Faith in and advocacy of dialogue cannot be an abstract idea, neither can it live in a vacuum. We (Syria's sons) are not stray stars or planets that have gone off course and left their orbits. We, rather, do have a fixed established presence on the map of both time and place."
This goal also makes it incumbent to build a society that enjoys solidarity and cooperation, and set up civil society institutions with their political, social, economic, cultural and professional units in order to contribute to protecting and edifying the society and setting up the regulations and mechanisms that help exploit the country's resources and employ them for its development and lay down the controls and rules that prevent the spread of corruption in its various forms and types and protect public property and preserve the country's resources.
It declares its signatories' commitment to facing external challenges imposed on the country whatever their sources are with a spirit of unity and the mechanisms and tools of political democratic action together with giving up violence. They also pledge to support promoters of human rights and the principled equality between men and women regarding human and civilian rights.
What is new in the current conference is its endorsement of the necessity of political plurality and its emphasis on the language of dialogue. The conferees stressed the importance of dialogue for building the political civil society and the warm call for transcending the state of weakness ensuing from the absence of dialogue.
That is why it is believed by the participants that the national charter conference will be open to receive further forces and personalities.
An independent Syrian personality that attended the conference, Haitham Manah who is the spokesman of the Arab Committee for Human Rights rejected some excuses that cited the timing or the place indicating that "there are some people who regard dialogue with Muslim Brotherhood as bringing about more costs than benefits as well as provocative to the political and security authorities in Syria."
Barot did not deny the presence of two trends inside the Muslim Brotherhood group radical and liberal.
The Engineers Syndicate in Jordan has always been the mother of all syndicates. Its current leadership has not only allegiance to the Ikhwanite Islamic trend but is also an integral part of it. The government directs an implied message of peace to the Ikhwans in the first place and then to syndicate institutions when it enters publicly into joint and investment projects with Islamists of syndicate action leaders.
The internal message of the situation may be the more important in relation to the internal position. Trade unionists represented in the most important of their institutions are partners to the government in the vital commercial and economic field. The government recognizes their right to participate. What is required of the parties is to set differences and divisions aside to concentrate on common grounds as the government approval of the trade unionist Arab unity march attracts the attention of Syria as well as Iraq to the fact that it is not against solidarity with them.
Premier Ali Abou-Raghib was the first to get the royal message to place the Islamists in the forefront of the forces that must be consulted for achieving reform. He announced the start of a constant government dialogue with civil society institutions, opened his office's gates to unionist and reassured them. Head of Syndicate Chairmen council, Hashim Gharaybia said that the government was not considering passing a temporary law forcing syndicates to confine themselves to syndicate action only, as the cons of change report.
In a nutshell, the supreme authorities have discovered the proper recipe for assimilating civil society institutions and started a workshop to attract the Islamic trend or at least appease it at a time of anticipated regional development. Abou Raghib's government seems to have relatively succeeded so far in gaining the confidence of syndicates and began a rapprochement with them after paying the required price, namely giving up the black thoughts of passing a spate of permanent legal amendments that prejudice trade unions, and consequently, the last strong- holds of the Islamists.
He not only allowed the construction of the big North Korean nuclear project, but also respected the promises made by the former administration to help North Korea execute it through a gathering comprising three big US allies under the leadership of the US itself. The gathering which is so-called Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization comprised the EU, Japan, and South Korea, the enemy of the communism in the northern part.
The latest campaign launched by Washington focussed on Al-Tagi foodstuffs storehouse in the suburbs of Baghdad. The storehouse appeared on the US monitors as a factory for weapons of mass destruction because the US only reported intensive movement of trucks in the vicinity of the storehouse.
The students coming from non-Arab non-Muslim developing countries are allowed to join these departments while students of certain nationalities are not allowed, what does this mean?
The subjection of the world to three-standard system is not a new thing to the US administrations, which have frequently turned a blind eye to programs and projects in developing countries, but has never allowed the Arab countries or Iran to have similar or even less developed programs and projects. The 11 September events unveiled the three-standard system, which the Bush Administration considered its only compass.
Quite a number of dignitaries have recently been brought to book by the judiciary including former Giza governor Maher Al-Gindi, former minister of finance, Dr. Mohieddin Al-Gharib, former minister of tourism, Tawfeek Abdu Ismail, head of the parliamentary economic committee Abdullah Tayel, who doubles as former president of Misr Exterior Bank; the television news sector chairman, Mohamed Al-Wakeel and president of Principal Bank for Development and Agricultural Credit, Youssef Abdel-Rahman, who is very close to Deputy Premier and ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) Secretary General, Youssef Wali.

The Egyptian Administrative Judiciary Court examines next month the biggest recovery action presented by an Egyptian citizen. The plaintiff asked the Foreign Minister to recover LE6.628 billion ($1.5bn) from Turkey in compensation for what Egypt had paid to Turkey in Jizya (tribute) during the Ottoman Caliphate era.
Three questions posed by a Muslim Brotherhood deputy in the Egyptian parliament to Premier Atef Ebeid and the ministers of Information, Safwat Al-Sherif and Internal Trade Hassan Khedr threatened to trigger a crisis between the two parties after Ebeid and his two ministers ignored the questions about the proceeds of selling a public company within the framework of the privatization programme and the truth of Egypt importing bad wheat from Australia and the retreat of the Egyptian television for all its numerous and various channels before Arab satellite channels.
He said, "This coincided with the errors in the implementation of the privatization programme starting to emerge after the sale of one of the companies had unprecedentedly been cancelled and the company returned to the government. It was Kaha for Preserved Foods whose buyer had defaulted on payments and turned its personnel jobless.
They added that such things trigger suspicion and make the government guilty of violating the constitution. This makes it incumbent on the parliament, in order to preserve its deputies' dignity, to take a serious step through reaching a charter of honour between the government and the deputies, thus making the premier accountable for his government responsibilities to the parliament so that the goal of parliamentary control over the government acts is achieved and in order to abide by the rules of the constitution.
The collapse is ascribed to CBE withdrawal of a big part of the reserve to meet local market dollar needs required for clinching some import-related deals, the report indicated.

DAMASCUS: NO POLITICAL VETO ON MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD
The Syrian Presidency dealt positively with the mediation and showed an interest in the Muslim Brotherhood issue.

The decline percentage reached 29%.
Export transactions with the two Americas countries went up to 195.8 thousand kantars, against 66 thousands in 2000/2001 season, a rise rate estimated at about 197%.

INVESTORS' SOCIETIES CALL FOR SCHEDULING DEFAULTERS' DEBTS OVER 10 YEARS
In light of such governmental support, the factories that have stopped production operated would reopen, thus ensuring the repayment of debts on time, Khamis said. "This will not be achieved unless a bold decision is issued by the Government on a par with the decree it issued extending financial support to garment and foodstuff exporters, which positively reflected on the balance of trade."
Furthermore, Egyptian bankers have warned against foreign banks expanding the issuance of long-term loans. Delta International Bank board chairman, Ali Negm demanded the issuance of long-term bonds for considerable sums, pointing out that banks' resorting to the issuance of bonds and borrowing from the domestic markets contravenes their raison d'être and activity which is supposed to attract external capital to the domestic market. He pointed out that the phenomenon of banks scrambling to issue long and medium term bonds under the pretext that they would provide stable and less expensive financing sources, may well involve banks in problems if those banks' resources and the liquidity they would create are not employed for projects that would be remunerative enough to cover the interest rate and the cost of the bonds issuance. He added that Delta International Bank did not resort to bonds and preferred borrowing through the Interbank system.
Dr Al-Refaie said that the statement of printing additional amounts of Egyptian pounds has become out of fashion as the Government has now shifted to the manner of directly borrowing from the CBE after the banks failure to provide the required liquidity. The Government, nevertheless, would have to repay the money it borrowed after a period of grace that did not exceed three months from the date of the end of the next fiscal year. The debt would also be replaced by treasury bonds.
Premier, Dr Atef Ebeid issued a decree appointing Mustafa Abou El Futoh as Board Chairman of Egyptian Arab Land Bank as a successor of Alaa Al Osiah.

He explained that this year witnessed a clear commitment by free profession taxpayers, namely artists, physicians, accountants and lawyers, something that can be shown through the 40% increase of the department proceeds over the previous years. Hamman ascribed this action to the good treatment received by taxpayers and the issuance of a decision adding all free professions files in different departments in Cairo to the main free professions tax department for equal unified treatment so that no discrimination may take place between free profession taxpayers and commercial or industrial profit taxpayers. This is also attributed to the free professions department's understanding of the nature of dealing with free professions taxpayers as far as examination, tax assessment, and collection are concerned.
Tin iron price went up by 19% in less than a fortnight.
They just paid the fines provided for in their diverse contracts.
He attributed that slight retreat in the prices the market witnessed to the strict measures represented in the emergency room set up by the Egyptian Ministry of Industry for controlling the markets and detecting any monopolising actions.
He added that the situation is currently studied by the metal moulding companies or the company which monopolises the market to determine the reasons for such a spate of successive crises.
He added that the factories had stopped operating because they did not want to bear the possible losses ensuing from their implementation of the contracts in climates of big rises in raw materials prices. He pointed out that the current rise in tin iron prices was not the first of its kind as it had been presented. Before the successive dollar crises, the price per ton did not exceed LE1100 at most. When the dollar rate of exchange rose against the Egyptian pound the price of iron rose to LE1200, which was a reasonable rise, but only a few months later, it rose again to LE1420. Regardless of such rises, metal moulding factories could transcend them without having to stop operation until the recent rise which can be ascribed only to a wish to manipulate the markets.
SIZE OF GERMAN INVESTMENTS IN EGYPT HITS LE739 MILLION

A plan was underway to develop the tourist exchange, but it was negatively affected by the September 11th events, he said, hoping that a tourist bourse would be established, but the project was also a fiasco, claiming that he heard of a relevant agreement concluded between Ankara and Tel Aviv.
Intensive meetings should be held between Egyptian and Turkish officials on reinforcing bilateral cooperation, he said, adding that since he took over, only the minister of petroleum visited Turkey in February 2000. Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa also visited Turkey when he was Egypt's foreign minister, but the tour was not completed, he added.
Minister of Foreign Trade, Dr. Youssef Botors Ghali said that the coming period would witness great efforts so that the Egyptian exports could restore the Russian market especially vegetables, fruits, different kinds of cotton and other Egyptian industries.
The Commercial Representation, an affiliate of Foreign Trade Ministry said that 300 thousand tons had been contracted as a first batch. Such contracts have been the result of Minister of Foreign Trade Dr. Youssef Botros Ghali's efforts with a view to boosting exports and promoting trade relations with India during his visit to it last January in which some ministers and dignitaries participated last January.

HISHAM IZZ EL ARAB, PRESIDENT OF CIB

The figures of the balance of payment for the fiscal year 2001/2002 ending late last June included a number of unpleasant surprises such as the retreat in total exports by 6.1% against the last fiscal year, and the retreat in the value of petroleum exports by 28%, the decrease in investment revenues by 49%, the reduction of private remittances by 1.5%.
Most importantly, total resources in the total balance of payment went down by 7%. As usual, CBE governor understated the matter when reviewing some balance of payment figures as he concentrated on total deficit retreat in the balance of payment to $447 million against $871 million in the previous fiscal year.
The same thing applies to the retreat in medium goods and raw materials imports as an increase in exports requires an increase in imports owing to the increase in the foreign component in goods to be exported.
The efforts made by the Investment Authority, businessmen associations or door-knocking missions as well as other bodies have not succeeded yet in attracting investments.
The balance of payment figures point out that the petroleum balance is still tipping not in our favour by about $525 million as our exports of crude oil yearly hit $1.9 billion, but our imports of petroleum products hit about $2.4 billion.
SHARM EL-SHEIKH BUBBLE
Several observers commented on the "total figure", which was crowned in the conference saying it is "a joke" that can hardly be believed. They sometimes believed and sometimes not. However, the bubble of Sharm El-Sheikh funds quickly vanished with Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Fayza Abul-Naga and deputy chairman of the World Bank announcing that loans and aid approved by the donor countries are new funds and commitments rather than previous commitments to the government.
First: Announcing commitment to provide 1.85 billion dollars over the coming three years as part of the current aid plan. If the US Administration can provide the commitments, they must be endorsed by the Congress.
What can be concluded is that the funds announced by the US is part of the US aid and collective proceeds of the annual aid programs over three years. They are mere commitments that are decided by the Congress, which is invested to endorse the US budget and control the US interests and what serves them.
Ambassador Mohammad Kamil Amr, who represents Egypt and the Arab group in the World Bank said that these loans are based on policies under negotiations with the Egyptian government.
40% INCREASE IN CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS
The report ascribed this change on the Egyptian market to the increasing approval of using electronic cards in sale outlets as the number of traders who use such kinds of cards has skyrocketed to over 17 thousand traders.
Director of the Strategic Studies Institue in Washington, Dr. Salwa Huzein says that some banks had transcended the credit ceilings, attributing this to banks' optimism whether about the client's performance or the markets, which was not well grounded. In the Egyptian market, there are, thus, clients who got funds from banks that exceeded their projects financing needs, besides the weak follow-up techniques used for monitoring how such funds were being used by the borrowers, which led to the phenomenon of faltering clients and, in some cases, escape with the banks funds abroad.
In regard with the problem of escapees, Dr. Salwa points out banks' error in granting them huge loans. Some of them even tended to use 100% bank loaned funds for financing their projects while remitting their own assets abroad in order to use them in speculations whether in real estate markets or different currencies.
