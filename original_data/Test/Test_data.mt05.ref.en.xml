<seg id="2">Ankara 12-1 (AFP) - Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced today, Wednesday, that Ankara would refuse all pressures applied on it by the European Union to force it to recognize Cyprus. That came two weeks before the summit of the presidents and prime ministers of the European Union, who would decide on whether to open negotiations on joining with Ankara or not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Erdogan said to "NTV" TV station that the "European Union can not communicate with us by imposing on us new conditions related to Cyprus.</seg>
<seg id="4">We will discuss this file during the negotiations on joining."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">He added, "Let me be clear. Turkey's arm should not be twisted. This is unacceptable to us."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">It is expected that the European Parliament, on December 14, will recommend to the presidents and prime ministers of the Union to approve the start of negotiations on joining with Ankara, but with certain conditions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Greece considers Ankara's recognition of Cyprus, which also became a member of the European Union, "an obvious prerequisite" for the European Union to grant its green light to start negotiations on joining with Ankara.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Turkey still refuses to recognize the Republic of Cyprus, which became a member of the European Union on the first of last May, yet it is the only country in the world that has recognized the "Turkish Republic of North Cyprus," which declared its autonomy in the north of the island.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Erdogan also refused the proposal to open negotiations for the establishment of a special partnership between Turkey and the European Union as an alternative to the negotiations on joining.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Erdogan said in that regard, "This unacceptable proposal is not compatible with a serious organization like the European Union."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">He added, "we like to start negotiations in the first six months of 2005 or, if that was not possible, in the second part of the year (..) but we can not declare the year 2006 as the start of negotiations."</seg>
